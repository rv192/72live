News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring... **Bang! Pop! Wow!**

First up, something amazing from the animal world and science! Scientists from China and the United States have been working together. They've discovered something very important about the **H5N1 (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza)** virus (禽流感病毒 H5N1). This virus is a type of bird flu, but it started infecting cows! It's a **zoonotic disease** (人兽共患病), which means it can pass from animals to humans. Since 2021, this virus has been very busy, spreading to many birds and poultry all around the world. Then, last year, it started appearing on **dairy farms** (奶牛场) in the **United States** (美国). It has infected cows on over 1,070 farms across 17 states! Imagine that many farms - it's like if every single farm in a huge area got sick at the same time! This made some cows feel very unwell, and sadly, up to 10% of sick cows haven't recovered. Also, over 41 farmworkers have gotten sick. People were worried because the virus could damage the cows' **mammary glands** (乳腺) and get into the milk.

Before this, scientists weren't quite sure how the virus first got into the cows' mammary glands. But now, scientists from the **Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences** (中国农业科学院) and the **Harbin Veterinary Research Institute** (哈尔滨兽医研究所) have made a super discovery! They found that cows' **oral tissues** (口腔组织) – that's the skin and inside their mouths – are special. They have tiny spots called **sialic acid receptors** (唾液酸受体) that the H5N1 virus likes to grab onto. So, if a cow eats or drinks something **contaminated** (污染的/unclean) with the virus, the virus can stick to these spots in their mouth. It can even stay there for several days.

Now, here's the clever part: The scientists found out that cows sometimes do things like **self-suckling** (自我哺乳), where they lick or suck on themselves, or **cross-suckling** (交叉哺乳), where they lick or suck on other cows. Because the virus is in their mouth tissues, this sucking can move the virus right from the mouth to the mammary glands! It's like using their mouth as a little bus ticket for the virus to travel! This is called **oral-to-udder transmission** (口腔到乳房传播). Isn't it interesting how complex virus spreading can be?

**Imagine** you are a super detective scientist, looking closely at tiny cells under a microscope. You are trying to see how a sneaky virus moves from one place to another in an animal's body. And then, you see it! The virus is using the cow's own mouth movements to travel! It must feel amazing to find something so important!

This finding is super helpful because now scientists know how the virus gets started in the mammary glands. They also confirmed that giving cows a **vaccination** (疫苗接种) can help protect them totally! Scientists in China have successfully used vaccines to protect chickens from bird flu for many years. Applying this idea to cows could be a great way to stop H5N1 from spreading in cattle and keep both animals and people safer.

So, if you were a scientist, and you had discovered this important way the virus spreads, what is the very first thing you would tell all the farmers? What would you ask kids to do to help keep animals healthy?

Next up, let's talk about something really fun and creative: video games! Did you know that video games are helping young people connect with **traditional culture** (传统文化) in China? It's true! Games with **immersive** (沉浸式/absorbing) digital design are inspiring players, especially **Gen Z** (Z世代) kids like you, to learn about old traditions and arts. They are even helping more people visit historical places!

One popular game, "Ashes of the Kingdom" (天地劫：幽城再临), launched in China and quickly captured players' imaginations. It has a very **richly detailed** (细节丰富的) world from the ancient Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms periods. Players loved exploring this world. Then, something cool happened in **Yangzhou** (扬州), a city in **Jiangsu province** (江苏省) in China. The game worked with real historical places in Yangzhou, like famous gardens. They turned these real places into places you could visit and do quests in the game!

This project drew thousands of young visitors to Yangzhou. They were super **eager to trace** (渴望追寻) things they saw in the game, like beautiful **lacquerware motifs** (漆器纹样), which are designs made with shiny lacquer.

**Imagine** you are playing your favorite game, running through amazing ancient buildings. Then you look up the real address, travel there with your family, and suddenly you are standing in the *actual* garden you just explored virtually! You can see the same shapes and patterns! It must feel like stepping into a time machine!

This "game-plus-heritage" (游戏+非遗) idea is turning cultural landmarks into **living classrooms** (活的教室)! During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, a museum in Yangzhou that shows **Intangible Cultural Heritage** (非物质文化遗产) treasures welcomed about 20,000 visitors *every single day*! Many of these visitors were game fans! At the museum, they could even do a hands-on activity: learn from **master artisans** (工艺大师) how to sketch and create beautiful **mother-of-pearl inlay** (珍珠母贝镶嵌) designs, just like the ones in the game! It's turning digital pictures into **tangible artworks** (实物艺术品) you can touch and keep.

The numbers show how popular this is! Online searches about Yangzhou's cultural tourism went up by 300% during the project. That means three times as many people were looking it up online! The teams who make these games are often young people themselves. They use real history to make their games fun and interesting. They choose special things, like lacquerware, ancient music (**guqin music** / 古琴音乐), or **traditional attire** (传统服饰), to make players curious to learn more. It's like a **two-way journey** (双向旅程) – the game invites players in, and the players bring new ideas back to the old traditions.

Even the government is helping! The Ministry of Commerce (商务部) has a plan to help Chinese games become popular overseas, and the Ministry of Education (教育部) has approved new university courses about making game art, even teaching how to use digital tools to save and show traditional beauty. The game industry in China is growing fast! Last year, Chinese games made $18.56 billion from overseas sales, which is more than before!

This shows that using new ways like video games can help everyone, especially young people, learn about and love old culture!

What other fun modern ways, besides games, do you think could help kids explore history and culture? Or, if you could make a game about any historical place or tradition from your country, what would it be?

That's all for our news discoveries today! See you next time!

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要一起探索... **嘭！啵！哇！**

首先，来听一个跟动物和科学有关的超赞发现！中国的科学家和美国的科学家们一起努力，发现了一个关于 **H5N1 (高致病性禽流感)** 病毒（禽流感病毒 H5N1）的超级重要秘密！这种病毒本来是一种禽流感，但后来竟然跑去感染奶牛了！它是一种 **人兽共患病**（人兽共患病），意思就是可以从动物传染给人。从2021年开始，这种病毒就特别忙，在世界各地的野鸟和家禽中传啊传。然后去年，它开始在美国（美国）的奶牛场（奶牛场）里冒出来了。它感染了美国17个州（州）的1070多个奶牛场！想象一下，1070个奶牛场啊，那简直就像一大片地方的所有农场都同时生病了一样！这让一些奶牛感到非常不舒服，而且很伤心的是，高达10%生病的奶牛都没能好起来。还有超过41位农场工人也生病了。大家都很担心，因为病毒会伤害奶牛的乳腺（乳腺），然后可能跑到牛奶里去。

之前，科学家们还不太清楚这个病毒最初是怎么跑到奶牛的乳腺里的。但现在，来自中国农业科学院（中国农业科学院）和哈尔滨兽医研究所（哈尔滨兽医研究所）的科学家们有了一个超级大发现！他们发现奶牛的口腔组织（口腔组织）——就是它们嘴巴里面的皮肤——特别特别。它们那里有一些小小的点，叫做唾液酸受体（唾液酸受体），H5N1病毒特别喜欢抓住这些点。所以，如果一头奶牛吃了或者喝了被污染的（污染的/不干净的）东西，病毒就会粘在它们嘴巴里的这些点上。病毒甚至可以在那里待好几天呢。

现在，厉害的地方来了：科学家们发现奶牛有时候会做一些动作，比如自我哺乳（自我哺乳），就是自己舔自己或者吸自己；或者交叉哺乳（交叉哺乳），就是互相舔或者吸别的奶牛。因为病毒在它们嘴巴的组织里，这些吸吮的动作就能把病毒直接从嘴巴带到乳腺去！这简直就像病毒坐着奶牛的嘴巴坐了一趟小巴士！这个过程叫做口腔到乳房传播（口腔到乳房传播）。病毒传播的方式是不是很奇妙呀？

**想象**你是一位超厉害的侦探科学家，正拿着放大镜，仔细地盯着显微镜下的微小细胞。你想看看一个偷偷摸摸的病毒是怎样在动物身体里从一个地方跑到另一个地方的。然后，你看到了！病毒竟然是利用奶牛自己嘴巴的动作来旅行的！发现这么重要的秘密，一定感觉棒极了！

这个发现超级有帮助，因为现在科学家们知道病毒是怎么开始跑到乳腺里的了。他们还确认了给奶牛打疫苗（疫苗接种）可以完全保护它们！中国的科学家已经用疫苗成功保护鸡群不被禽流感侵害很多年了。把这个办法用到奶牛身上，可能就是阻止H5N1在牛群里传播的好办法，让动物和我们都更安全。

所以，如果你是一位科学家，发现了这个病毒传播的重要方式，你会第一时间告诉所有的农场主什么呢？你还会让小朋友们做些什么来帮助保护动物的健康呢？

接下来，我们来聊一个特别好玩又有创意的事：电子游戏！你知道吗，电子游戏正在帮助咱们年轻人和中国的传统文化（传统文化）连接起来！这是真的！那些有沉浸式（沉浸式/让人感觉置身其中）数字设计的游戏，正在启发玩家们，特别是像你们这样的Z世代（Z世代）小朋友，去了解古老的传统和艺术。它们甚至还让更多人去参观历史悠久的地方呢！

有一个很火的游戏，叫做“天地劫：幽城再临”（天地劫：幽城再临），在中国上线后很快就抓住了玩家们的想象力。它有一个超多细节的（细节丰富的）世界，来自咱们古代的东汉（东汉）和三国（三国）时期。玩家们超喜欢在游戏里探索这个世界。然后，在中国的江苏省（江苏省）有个城市叫扬州（扬州），发生了一件超酷的事情。这个游戏竟然和扬州的真实历史景点合作了，比如那些有名的园林！他们把这些真实的地方变成了你在游戏里可以参观和做任务的地方！

这个合作项目吸引了成千上万的年轻人来扬州玩。他们都迫不及待地想去追寻（渴望追寻）在游戏里看到的那些东西，比如漂亮的漆器纹样（漆器纹样），就是用发亮的漆做的花纹。

**想象**你正在玩你最喜欢的游戏，在游戏里飞奔穿过那些了不起的古代建筑。然后你查了一下真实的地址，和家人一起旅行去了那里，突然！你竟然站在了你刚刚在游戏里逛过的那个真实的园林里！你可以看到一样的形状和花纹！那感觉简直就像穿越时空了一样！

这个“游戏+非遗”（“游戏+非遗”）的点子，正在把文化地标变成活的教室（活的教室）！在端午节假期的时候，扬州一个展示非物质文化遗产（非物质文化遗产）宝贝的博物馆，每天竟然有大约20000个游客来参观！这些游客好多都是游戏迷！在博物馆里，他们甚至可以亲手体验：跟着工艺大师（工艺大师）学习怎么素描和制作漂亮的珍珠母贝镶嵌（珍珠母贝镶嵌）图案，就像游戏里看到的一样！这是把游戏里的数字图案变成了你可以摸到、可以带回家的实物艺术品（实物艺术品）。

数字也告诉我们这个有多受欢迎！在项目期间，网上搜索扬州文化旅游的人增加了300%！那就是说，在网上搜的人多了三倍！做这些游戏的公司里，有很多都是年轻人。他们会把真实的 역사（历史）放进游戏里，让游戏既好玩又能学到东西。他们会选一些特别的文化片段（有代表性的文化片段），比如漆器、古琴音乐（古琴音乐），或者传统服饰（传统服饰），来激发玩家们的好奇心，让他们想去了解更多。这就像是一趟双向旅程（双向旅程）——游戏邀请玩家们进来，而玩家们又会给这些古老的传统带来新的视角（带来新的视角）。

连国家都在帮忙呢！商务部（商务部）有一个计划，要帮助中国的游戏在海外变得更受欢迎，而教育部（教育部）批准了一些新的大学专业，就是教大家怎么做游戏美术，甚至教怎么用数字方法来保存和展示传统的美。中国的游戏产业发展得可快了！去年，中国的游戏在海外卖了185.6亿美元，比之前更多了呢！

这说明，用电子游戏这种新方法，真的可以帮助大家，特别是咱们年轻人，学习和热爱古老的文化！

除了游戏，你觉得还有什么好玩的、新的方法，可以帮助小朋友们探索历史和文化呢？或者，如果你可以做一个关于你家乡任何一个历史地方或者传统风俗的游戏，你会做什么样的游戏呀？

今天的新闻探索就到这里啦！咱们下次再见！
