**Host:** News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow! A rocket's powerful journey into space and a super-train's epic trip across continents!

Hello everyone, and welcome back to our weekly news express for young explorers! I'm your host, Alex. We have seen some truly amazing things happen this past week, and I can't wait to share them with you. So, let's buckle up and get started with our first piece of news, which is literally out of this world!

**Story 1: A New Star in the Sky!**

China has just launched a brand-new satellite into space! On Sunday evening, from a special place called the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in Hainan, a rocket roared to life. This wasn't just any rocket; it was a modified Long March 7 carrier rocket, and it had a very important passenger: the Shijian 28 satellite. The launch happened at 8:20 PM Beijing Time, and everything went perfectly. The satellite has successfully entered its preset orbit, which is exactly where it needs to be to start its job high above the Earth.

This launch is a really big deal. Why? Because this was the 611th flight mission for the Long March rocket family. Let's try to picture how many that is. Imagine your school year has about 200 days. Six hundred and eleven launches is like launching one rocket every single day for more than three full school years, without ever taking a day off! That’s a lot of rockets and shows how busy and dedicated the space teams have been. We have heard the countdown, and we have felt the excitement from the ground.

Now, let's have a little fun with our imagination. **(Immersive Scene)** Imagine you are standing on a warm beach in Hainan at night. You can hear the gentle waves and see countless stars twinkling in the dark sky. Suddenly, you feel a deep rumble in the ground, like a giant waking up. You look towards the launch site and see a brilliant, fiery light, brighter than anything you've ever seen. It’s the Long March 7 rocket! It's climbing higher and higher, a blazing beacon on its way to the stars. The powerful sound fills the air as it pushes its precious cargo, the Shijian 28 satellite, into the quiet of space. It's a truly awesome sight to behold!

We haven't been told the exact job of the Shijian 28 satellite yet, but satellites usually have very important tasks. Some help us with weather forecasts, others provide the internet and phone signals we use every day, and some explore distant planets. They are our eyes and ears in the vast universe. This successful launch is another great step in our journey to understand more about the world around us and the space beyond. **(Open-ended Question)** So, here’s a thought for you: if you could design and launch your own satellite, what special mission would you give it?

**Story 2: The Speedy Dragon Train to Europe!**

Next up, we are leaving space and coming back down to Earth for a story about an incredible journey on rails. A new, super-efficient freight train service has just started, connecting the city of Chongqing in Southwest China all the way to Budapest, the capital of Hungary in Europe! This isn't just any train; it's a fixed-schedule China-Europe freight train, which is also known as the China Railway Express.

This special train departed on Sunday, and it’s packed with all sorts of interesting things. It is carrying automotive and motorcycle parts, electronic products, and many other consumer goods. Maybe the next cool gadget or toy you get has traveled on a train just like this one! This amazing journey is expected to take about 11 days. The train will travel through many countries, including Kazakhstan, Poland, and the Czech Republic, before arriving at its final stop.

What makes this train so special? It’s a "fixed-schedule" service. Think of it like your school bus. You know exactly when it will arrive and what route it will take. This makes everything much more predictable and reliable. According to the China Railway Chengdu Group, this new Chongqing-Budapest route reduces the travel time by around 30 percent compared to the older trains! That’s a huge improvement, saving almost one-third of the time. This fantastic efficiency helps companies plan better and gets products to stores faster. It's a game-changer for logistics!

The China-Europe freight trains have achieved some amazing numbers. They have made a **cumulative** (total/all together) 120,000 trips so far. All those trains have transported goods worth more than 490 billion US dollars! **(Data Visualization)** Let's make that number easier to understand. If a popular new video game console costs $500, that amount of money could buy 980 million of them! That's more than enough to give one to every single person living in Europe, with many left over! It shows how much trade is happening along this modern-day Silk Road.

**(Immersive Scene)** Let’s imagine you are a small electronic toy inside a big shipping box on this train. It’s dark and cozy. You can feel a gentle, constant rocking as the train moves. You hear the rhythmic 'click-clack, click-clack' of the wheels on the steel tracks. You feel the train speeding through vast grasslands in Kazakhstan and crossing famous rivers in Poland. Days go by, and finally, you feel the train slow to a stop. The box opens, and sunlight pours in! You see new sights and hear a new language. You have arrived in Budapest, ready for a new adventure in a new home!

This network of trains now reaches 232 cities in 26 European countries. It's like a giant web connecting people and businesses across continents. **(Open-ended Question)** If you could use this super-train to send a care package to a friend in Europe, what would you put inside it to share a piece of your world with them?

That’s all the time we have for today! Keep your eyes open, stay curious, and join me next time for more amazing stories on News Discovery Time!

**主持人：** 新闻大发现！今天我们要疾驰着去探索……砰！啪！哇！一枚火箭冲向太空的威力之旅，还有一列超级火车横跨大陆的史诗级旅行！

大家好，欢迎回到我们的每周少年探索者新闻快报！我是你们的主持人，小艾。过去一周发生了一些超级了不起的事情，我简直等不及要和你们分享啦。所以，系好安全带，让我们从第一条新闻开始，这条新闻真的能带我们“离开地球表面”哦！

**第一条：夜空中最亮的“新星”！**

中国刚刚向太空发射了一颗全新的卫星！上周日晚上，在海南省的文昌航天发射场，一枚火箭伴随着巨大的轰鸣声拔地而起。这可不是普通的火箭，它是一枚改进型的长征七号运载火箭（Long March 7 carrier rocket），而且它还搭载了一位非常重要的乘客：实践二十八号（Shijian 28）卫星。发射时间是北京时间晚上8点20分，整个过程都非常顺利。现在，这颗卫星已经成功进入了它预设的轨道，这正是它在地球上方开始工作所需要到达的精确位置。

这次发射可是一件大事。为什么呢？因为这是长征系列运载火箭家族的第611次飞行任务。我们来想象一下611次到底有多少。假设你的一个学年大约有200个上学日。那么611次发射，就好像是连续三个多学年的时间里，每天都要发射一枚火箭，一天都不休息！简直不要太厉害！这说明我们的航天团队一直以来是多么的忙碌和专注。我们仿佛听到了倒计时的声音，感受到了来自地面的那份激动。

现在，让我们一起放飞想象力。**（沉浸式场景）** 想象一下，夜晚你正站在海南温暖的沙滩上。你能听到海浪温柔的拍岸声，看到数不清的星星在夜空中闪烁。突然，你感觉到脚下的大地传来一阵低沉的震动，就像一个沉睡的巨人苏醒了。你望向发射场的方向，看到一团无比明亮的火焰，比你见过的任何东西都要亮。那就是长征七号火箭！它正不断向上攀升，像一座燃烧的灯塔，奔向星辰大海。那强有力的轰鸣声响彻云霄，因为它正把宝贵的“乘客”——实践二十八号卫星，推向宁静的太空。这真是一个令人惊叹的场面！

虽然我们还不知道实践二十八号卫星的具体任务是什么，但卫星通常都有非常重要的工作。有些卫星帮助我们预报天气，有些为我们每天使用的手机和网络提供信号，还有一些则去探索遥远的星球。它们就是我们在浩瀚宇宙中的眼睛和耳朵。这次的成功发射，是我们探索世界、了解宇宙的旅程中又迈出的伟大一步。**（开放式追问）** 那么，问题来了：如果你可以设计并发射一颗属于你自己的卫星，你会给它一个什么样子的特殊任务呢？

**第二条：开往欧洲的“神龙快车”！**

接下来，我们离开太空，回到地球，来听一个关于铁轨上奇妙旅行的故事。一条全新的、超级高效的货运火车服务刚刚开通啦，它连接了中国西南部的城市重庆和欧洲国家匈牙利（Xiōngyálì）的首都布达佩斯！这可不是一趟普通的火车，它是一列“固定班期”的中欧班列（China Railway Express）。

这趟特别的列车在周日出发，车上装满了各种各样有趣的东西。它运载着汽车和摩托车的零件、电子产品以及许多其他的消费品。说不定你下一个到手的新奇玩具，就是坐着这样的火车旅行过来的呢！这段奇妙的旅程预计将花费大约11天。火车会经过许多国家，比如哈萨克斯坦、波兰和捷克，最后才抵达它的终点站。

那这趟火车到底有什么特别之处呢？它是一项“固定班期”服务。你可以把它想象成你的校车。你很清楚它什么时候会到，会走哪条路线。这让一切都变得更有预见性，也更可靠。根据中国铁路成都局集团有限公司的说法，这条新的重庆-布达佩斯线路，比起以前的传统火车，能把旅行时间缩短大约30%！这可是一个巨大的进步，节省了将近三分之一的时间。这种了不起的效率能帮助公司更好地做计划，也能让商品更快地送到商店里。这对于物流运输来说，简直是颠覆性的改变！

中欧班列已经取得了非常惊人的成绩。到目前为止，它们已经累计开行了12万趟。所有这些列车运输的货物价值超过了4900亿美元！**（核心数据可视化）** 我们把这个数字变得好懂一点。如果一台新款的流行游戏机需要500美元，那么这笔钱可以买下9亿8千万台！这个数量，给生活在欧洲的每一个人都发一台还绰绰有余呢！这说明了在这条现代丝绸之路上，有多少货物在往来穿梭。

**（沉浸式场景）** 让我们想象一下，你是一个小小的电子玩具，正待在这趟火车一个巨大的集装箱里。箱子里黑乎乎的，但很舒适。你能感觉到火车前进时带来的一种持续而轻柔的摇摆。你听着车轮压过钢轨时发出的有节奏的“咔嗒、咔嗒”声。你感觉到火车正飞速穿过哈萨克斯坦广阔的草原，跨过波兰著名的河流。一天天过去，最后，你感到火车慢慢停了下来。箱子被打开，阳光一下子照了进来！你看到了全新的风景，听到了全新的语言。你已经到达了布达佩斯，准备在一个新的家庭里开始一场新的冒险！

这个火车网络现在已经连接了26个欧洲国家的232个城市。它就像一张巨大的网，把不同大洲的人们和商业紧密地联系在了一起。**（开放式追问）** 如果你可以用这趟超级火车给一个在欧洲的朋友寄一个“爱心包裹”，你会在里面放些什么东西，来和他们分享你世界里的一部分呢？

今天的时间就到这里啦！请大家保持敏锐的观察力，保持好奇心，我们下期《新闻大发现》再见，一起探索更多精彩的故事！
