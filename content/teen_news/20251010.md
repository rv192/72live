News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring amazing animals and incredible nature!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever seen a seal that gives penguins as gifts? Scientists in Antarctica (南冰洲 the southern continent) have been studying leopard seals and penguins across both Antarctica and South America. These seals have been seen catching penguins and then offering them to researchers, like a strange present! Imagine you're standing on the icy shore of Antarctica, watching a 3-meter-long leopard seal swim/slide gracefully through the water with a penguin in its mouth. Then, instead of eating it, the seal pushes the penguin toward you! This behavior is quite unusual (不寻常/rare) and scientists have observed (watched/seen) it happening over 30 times in the past year. These seals can weigh as much as 380 kilograms, which is about the same weight as 5 adult gorillas! Why do you think these leopard seals act this way? What would you do if a seal offered you a gift?

Next up, young scientists are helping to solve space mysteries! NASA (美国太空总署 the American Space Agency) has selected 15 students from around the world to join their latest space program. These kids, aged 10-14, have been analyzing (studying/looking at) data from the Event Horizon Telescope project that captured the first-ever image of a black hole. Imagine you're floating in space, looking at a massive (巨大的/huge) black hole that's 6.5 billion times heavier than our Sun! The students have been working with scientists for the past 6 months, helping to understand how black holes form and grow. They've examined over 200 images and discovered three new things about how matter behaves (acts/moves) near black holes. One student from Japan said, "I've always wanted to be an astronaut, but now I feel like I've already traveled to space!" Have you ever dreamed about going to space? What mysteries of our universe would you like to solve?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索奇妙的动物和令人惊叹的自然现象！

砰！啪！哇！

你见过送企鹅当礼物海豹吗？科学家们在南极洲（南冰洲 南方大陆）和南美洲两岸一直在研究豹海豹和企鹅。这些海豹捕到企鹅后，会像送礼物一样把它们送到研究人员面前！想象一下，你站在南极洲的冰岸上，看着一只3米长的豹海豹嘴里叼着一只企鹅，在水里疾驰滑行。然后，它竟然没有吃掉那只企鹅，反而把它推向你！这种行为非常罕见，科学家们在过去一年里已经观察到30多次了。这些豹海豹能重达380公斤，差不多相当于5只成年大猩猩的重量！你认为这些豹海豹为什么会这样做？如果有只海豹送你礼物，你会怎么办？

接下来，年轻科学家们正在帮助解开太空之谜！美国太空总署（NASA 美国太空总署）已经从全球选出了15名学生加入他们最新的太空项目。这些10到14岁的孩子们一直在分析来自事件视界望远镜项目的数据，该项目拍摄了人类历史上第一张黑洞照片。想象一下，你漂浮在太空中，看着一个比我们太阳重65亿倍的巨大黑洞！在过去6个月里，这些学生与科学家们一起工作，帮助理解黑洞是如何形成和成长的。他们已经检查了200多张图片，发现了三个关于物质在黑洞附近表现的新知识。来自日本的一名学生说："我一直想成为宇航员，现在我感觉自己已经去过太空了！"你曾经梦想过去太空吗？你想解开宇宙中的什么谜团？
