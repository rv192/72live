News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... animal wonders, space exploration, and cultural knots! Bang! Pop! Wow!

**Amazing Penguin and Leopard Seal Friendship Across Continents!**

Scientists have discovered something wonderful happening between two very different animals that live in both Antarctica and South Africa. Leopard seals, which are large predators, have been seen giving penguins as gifts to scientists! This behavior has been observed in both icy Antarctica and the warmer waters of South Africa, covering two different continents.

Imagine you're standing on a research boat in the cold Antarctic waters. You see a huge leopard seal swimming toward you with something in its mouth. At first, you feel scared, but then you realize it's holding a live penguin! The leopard seal gently releases the penguin near your boat and swims away. It has happened many times, with about 30 penguins being "gifted" this way. That's enough penguins to fill your entire classroom!

Researchers have felt confused/excited about this behavior. They wonder if the leopard seals are trying to communicate or if they just enjoy watching the penguins swim away. The penguins don't seem harmed and quickly swim to safety.

What would you do if a wild animal gave you a gift? Would you keep it or let it go free?

**Kids Join NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) for Mars Mission Design!**

NASA has invited children from around the world to help design the next Mars rover! Over 500 students from 15 countries have participated/joined this exciting project. The kids, between 8 and 14 years old, have shared their amazing ideas through drawings and models.

Picture yourself sitting in a room with real NASA scientists. You're explaining your design for a rover that could find water on Mars. The scientists listen carefully and ask questions about your ideas. Some students have suggested rovers that can jump like grasshoppers, while others have designed ones that can dig deep into the Martian soil.

One of the most popular ideas was from a 10-year-old girl from China who designed a rover with solar panels that can open like flower petals. NASA scientists said her design could collect/spoil 30% more energy than current rovers! That's enough power to run your home computer for a whole week.

The children's designs will be considered/included in the actual Mars rover that will launch in 2030. NASA has promised to send pictures from Mars to all the young designers.

If you could design something for space exploration, what would it be and what would it do?

**Beautiful String Art from Japanese Culture and Movie "Your Name"**

The Japanese movie "Your Name" has inspired many people to learn about Mizuhiki, which is a traditional Japanese art of tying decorative knots. These special knots made from paper cord have been part of Japanese culture for over 600 years. They represent connections between people, just like in the movie.

Imagine holding a colorful string in your hands. You twist and fold it carefully, following patterns that have been passed down for generations. Each knot tells a story about wishes for good fortune, happiness, and long life. Some Mizuhiki knots are shaped like butterflies, while others look like turtles or cranes.

In the movie "Your Name," the main character wears a red string bracelet that connects her to another person. In real Japanese culture, these knots are used for special occasions like weddings and births. People believe the knots can tie/attach good luck to the person who receives them.

You can make simple Mizuhiki knots at home! All you need are colored strings and instructions. You can start with a basic knot and work your way up to more complex designs. It's a fun way to create beautiful gifts for your friends and family.

What kind of story would you like to tell through your own string art creation?

新闻探索时间！今天我们将疾驰探索...动物奇观、太空探索和文化绳结！砰！啪！哇！

**跨越两大洲的企鹅和豹海豹奇妙友谊！**

科学家们发现了一种奇妙的现象，发生在两种截然不同但同时生活在南极洲和南非的动物之间。作为大型捕食者的豹海斑被发现把企鹅当作礼物送给科学家！这种行为在冰冷的南极洲和南非较温暖的水域都有观察到，覆盖了两个不同的大洲。

想象一下，你站在一艘研究船上，身处寒冷的南极水域。你看到一只巨大的豹海斑嘴里叼着什么东西向你游来。起初你感到害怕，但随即你意识到那是一只活企鹅！豹海斑轻轻地将企鹅释放到你的船边，然后游走了。这种情况已经发生了很多次，大约有30只企鹅以这种方式被"赠送"。这些企鹅足够填满你的整个教室！

研究人员对这种行为感到困惑又兴奋。他们想知道豹海斑是否在试图交流，或者它们只是喜欢看着企鹅游走。企鹅似乎没有受到伤害，很快就会游到安全的地方。

如果野生动物送你一份礼物，你会怎么做？你会把它留下还是让它自由？

**小朋友们加入NASA（美国太空总署）参与火星探测器设计！**

NASA已经邀请来自世界各地的儿童帮助设计下一代火星探测器！来自15个国家的500多名学生参加了这个令人兴奋的项目。这些8到14岁的孩子们通过图画和模型分享了他们惊人的想法。

设想一下，你坐在一个房间里，周围都是NASA的真正科学家。你正在解释你设计的能够找到火星上水的探测器。科学家们认真倾听并询问有关你想法的问题。一些学生建议设计像蚱蜢一样跳跃的探测器，而其他人设计的则能深入火星土壤。

其中一个最受欢迎的想法来自中国的一名10岁女孩，她设计了一台太阳能板可以像花朵花瓣一样展开的探测器。NASA科学家表示，她的设计比现有探测器多收集30%的能量！这些能量足以让你家里的电脑运行整整一周。

孩子们的设计将被考虑纳入将于2030年发射的实际火星探测器中。NASA已经承诺会把来自火星的照片发送给所有年轻设计师。

如果你可以为太空探索设计一些东西，那会是什么？它会做什么呢？

**来自日本文化和电影《你的名字。》的美丽绳结艺术**

日本电影《你的名字。》让许多人开始学习"水引"，这是一种用绳子打装饰结的传统日本艺术。这些由纸绳制成的特殊绳结在日本文化中已有600多年的历史。它们代表人与人之间的联系，就像电影中一样。

想象一下，你手中握着一条彩色的绳子。你仔细地扭转和折叠它，遵循着世代相传的图案。每个绳结都讲述着一个关于祝福好运、幸福和长寿的故事。一些"水引"绳结形状像蝴蝶，而其他的则看起来像乌龟或鹤。

在电影《你的名字。》中，主角戴着一条红色绳子手链，将她与另一个人联系起来。在真实的日本文化中，这些绳结用于婚礼和出生等特殊场合。人们相信这些绳结能给接受者带来好运。

你可以在家制作简单的"水引"绳结！你只需要彩色绳子和说明。你可以从基本的结开始，逐步制作更复杂的设计。这是为朋友家人创造美丽礼物的一种有趣方式。

你想通过自己的绳结艺术创作讲述什么样的故事呢？
