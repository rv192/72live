## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today, we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! amazing stories from around the world!

Get ready for a blast from the PAST! Scientists *have found* something truly amazing in Spain! It’s a tiny stone, but on it, they think they *have discovered* the OLDEST human fingerprint ever! This little mark is from about 43,000 years ago – wow! That's like stepping back 43,000 years in a time machine – way, way before pyramids were even thought of! Scientists believe this fingerprint belongs to a Neanderthal（尼安德特人/一种已灭绝的早期人类）, an early kind of human who lived in Europe and Asia long ago. They think a Neanderthal person dipped their finger in red paint and pressed it onto the stone. The spot where they put the paint *suggests*（暗示/indicates） it might have been a kind of ancient art! This discovery *is* super *unique*（独特/distinctive） because scientists have been talking a lot about whether Neanderthals could make art and think in abstract ways, like we do. Imagine yourself standing in that cave in Segovia（塞戈维亚）, Spain, thousands of years ago, watching a Neanderthal carefully dip their finger in red paint and press it onto a stone. This tiny print might be *valuable*（有价值/important） new proof that they were more like us than we first thought! The stone is seen as a kind of "portable art" piece, meaning they could carry it with them. Finding this fingerprint helps us understand more about the *ancient*（古代/old） past and the people who lived before us. It adds a new, exciting layer to the story of human history. What do YOU think this amazing tiny fingerprint tells us about people from the past?

Now, let's travel all the way to China for a heartwarming story about learning and helping! A wonderful teacher named Lan Guiping（兰桂萍/一位优秀教师） at Chongqing Normal University（重庆师范大学） *has dedicated*（致力于/committed） herself to teaching students who cannot hear well. For 10 years now, she *has worked* hard to find the very best ways to help them learn and grow. That's like helping enough students to fill ten big school buses over time! Learning can be tricky if you can't hear, but Ms. Lan *has gone* the extra mile. She *has learned* sign language so she can "talk" with her hands, and she uses special technology, like electronic sign language dictionaries, too. She also uses fresh examples and activities to make lessons interesting. Students *have told* her that her classes *feel* easy to understand and are full of meaning, saying her words "bloom in her hands." Imagine sitting in her classroom, seeing words bloom like colorful flowers from her hands, making everything easy to understand, and *feeling* how much she cares about every single student. She believes deeply that every single child deserves to *hear* (or *see*!) love and understand big ideas, guiding them towards a bright future. Her dedication *has had* a big *impact*（影响/effect）, helping her students learn, gain confidence, and even participate in research projects! She *has received* many awards for her innovative teaching methods. What's a new way YOU could try to learn something tricky? Maybe using pictures, building a model, or teaching it to a friend?

Our last story takes us back to China to meet a true inspiration! Tang Guoqiang（唐国强/一位木雕艺术家） is a super talented wood carver who *has overcome* huge challenges in his life. After a serious accident as a child left him unable to walk from the waist down, he *could have felt* like giving up on his dreams. But he *has shown* incredible *perseverance*（毅力/determination）! He taught himself wood carving, starting with just a rusty saw blade he found in a pile of old things. For 30 years, he *has practiced* and practiced, polishing his skills day by day. In that time, he *has created* over 700 beautiful pieces of art – that's more than one new creation every two weeks for three decades! His amazing skill *has won* him top awards, and some of his carvings, like one showing a journey on the Silk Road, *have sold* for a lot of money, showing how *remarkable*（非凡/outstanding） his art is. Imagine sitting in his workshop, smelling the wood, hearing the quiet scrape of tools, and seeing a simple block of wood slowly turn into something beautiful and full of life. The best part? He now teaches others, especially people who also have difficulties, sharing his gift and giving them hope and a way to build their own careers. He has a special saying from his father: "Three parts skill, seven parts willpower, one hundred percent humility, and a century of nurturing talent." He even makes his students practice carving simple walking canes, teaching them patience and making them "ruin" 49 canes before they master the basics – wow, talk about serious practice! Tang Guoqiang *has created* not just art, but also a place of hope and opportunity. Mr. Tang says practice and not giving up are key to creating wonderful things. Can YOU try making something small and simple with clay or drawing, maybe a fun shape or a small animal? Let's see what amazing things you can create with your own hands and imagination!

That's all for News Discovery Time today! Keep exploring and learning! Bye for now!

新闻发现时间到！今天，我们要一起来... 狂奔！跳跃！尖叫！探索神奇的世界！

第一个酷酷的故事，我们要准备好，穿越回超级久远的过去！科学家们在遥远的西班牙（Xi Ban Ya）发现了一个超乎想象的东西！他们找到一块小小的石头，上面竟然有可能是迄今为止，人类留下的最最古老的手指印！这个指印大概是43000年前的！你想想看，43000年，这可比我们知道的那些金字塔还要老多了！科学家觉得，这个指印属于尼安德特人（ni an de te ren / 一种已经消失的古人类），这是一种很久很久以前生活在欧洲和亚洲的早期人类。他们可能把手指蘸上红色的颜料，压在了石头上。这个小小的红点在石头上的位置，让科学家们觉得，这可能是一种非常早期的艺术品呢！简直不要太厉害！这个发现特别独特，因为大家一直在讨论尼安德特人是不是也会像我们一样搞艺术，会不会抽象地思考问题。想象一下，你真的站在那个几万年前的山洞里（在西班牙的塞戈维亚（Sai Ge Wei Ya）附近哦），亲眼看着尼安德特人小心翼翼地把手蘸上红色颜料，印在石头上！这个小小的指印，可能就是很有价值的新证据呢！这块石头被看作是一种可以带在身上的“便携艺术品”。找到这个指印，帮助我们更多地了解遥远的古代和生活在我们之前的人们。它为人类历史的故事，又添上了精彩的一笔！你觉得这个小小的手印告诉了我们什么呀？

接下来，我们飞到美丽的中国，听一个温暖人心的故事！在重庆师范大学（Chong Qing Shi Fan Da Xue），有一位叫兰桂萍（Lan Gui Ping / 一位特别棒的老师）的老师。她是一位超有爱、超有智慧的老师，全身心投入地帮助那些听不太清楚的学生学习！她已经坚持了整整10年！你想想，这10年她教过的学生，加起来能装满十辆大校车呢！兰老师太厉害了，她自己努力学习了手语，这样就可以直接用手和学生们交流，简直就像变魔法一样！她还用手语电子词典这些高科技小工具来帮忙，让学习更轻松。学生们都说，她的课特别好懂，也特别有意思，还说她把知识和爱意，“言语在手中生花”。闭上眼睛，想象你就是她的学生，坐在教室里。看着兰老师的手，像跳舞一样，把知识和爱意，嗖嗖地让知识飞入脑海！感受到她对每一个学生的关心！她深深地相信，每个小朋友都应该在学习的时候，感受到爱，也都能理解重要的知识，她就像指路灯一样，引领学生们“向阳生长”，走向美好的未来。她的努力太棒了，也获得了好多奖项，帮助好多学生变得越来越自信，越来越优秀！太赞了！你有什么想学但觉得有点难的东西吗？你会怎么试试新的学习方法呢？比如画出来，或者找小伙伴一起演一遍？试试看呀！

我们最后一个故事，再回到中国，去认识一位真正的榜样人物！唐国强（Tang Guo Qiang / 一位木雕大师）老师，是一位非常非常厉害的木雕艺术家！他小时候遇到了一场严重的意外，腿不能走路了。但这没有打败他！他展现了惊人的毅力，就像小草一样坚韧不拔，全身心地投入到木雕中，硬是靠自己，从一堆旧木头和一把生锈的锯子开始，雕刻出了自己的美丽新世界！他雕刻了700多件作品，想想看，坚持30年，平均每个月都能变出两件新宝贝呢！他现在手艺已经炉火纯青，获得过好多好多大奖，有一些作品，像刻画丝绸之路故事的，竟然卖到了12万块钱呢！对他来说，这是个巨大的鼓励和肯定！想象一下，你来到唐国强老师的小小工作室里，空气里飘着木头的香味，耳边是轻轻的雕刻声，看着一块普通的木头，在他手里一点点变成栩栩如生的艺术品！最让人感动的是，唐老师还收了很多学生，特别是那些身体不太方便的小伙伴，把自己的绝活都教给他们！他相信每个人都有无限的潜力，希望能帮助他们靠自己的双手创造美好的生活。他教学生的时候特别认真，甚至让他们先“毁掉”49根拐杖来练习基础！这简直不要太严格，但也说明了他的教学是多么用心！唐老师说，多练习和永不放弃特别重要，这样才能创造出最棒的东西。你也可以试试看呀，用橡皮泥或者彩笔，做个小动物或者画个有趣的图案，试试动手创造的感觉？我们一起来试试看，能用自己的双手和想象力创造出哪些神奇的东西吧！

今天的发现时间就到这里啦！希望你们也充满好奇心，继续去探索，去创造！我们下次见，拜拜！
