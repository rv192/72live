News Discovery Time! Today, we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, imagine the ground is shaking while you're watching TV! That’s exactly what *has happened* in Chile, South America. On April 15, 2025, a strong earthquake *has struck* the city of Copiapó (a city in northern Chile, South America). It was a 6.4 magnitude quake. And guess what? It hit right in the middle of a live television show! You could *see* the studio *walls wobbling*, the cameras *shaking*. The people on TV – a politician and two journalists – *looked* very surprised and maybe a little scared! They *had to leave* the studio very, very quickly as the shaking *continued*. The ground *trembled* for a little while, and some of the equipment *was damaged*. It was a sudden and unforgettable **disruption** (disturbance/interruption) during a regular day. A 6.4 magnitude earthquake releases energy that can feel super powerful! The shaking in the studio felt as strong as having fifty big elephants all stomping their feet at once right outside! Can you *feel* that tremor? If you were in that studio, what would you do first?

Next, let’s travel to China, where a university *has found* a clever way to help students with their feelings using technology! Xi'an Electronic Science and Technology University (a big university in Xi'an, China) *has created* a special system. Think of it like a super-smart digital friend who helps make sure students are feeling okay. This system uses special computer rules called algorithms (sets of computer rules) to look at different things, like how students are doing in their classes or what activities they are involved in. It helps the university *find* students who might be feeling sad or worried and need a little extra help. They *have also built* fun activities around this, like planting green plants to relax in a "Mind Garden," or using a "Tree Hole Drift Bottle" where students can anonymously share their thoughts and feelings. This *has been* a new way to give **support** (help/assistance) to young people. The technology *has been* really accurate, finding the right students who needed help almost 93% of the time! Imagine getting 93 questions right on a test out of 100 – that’s how good it is at spotting someone who might need a friendly chat! Imagine your school has a kind, quiet robot helper that watches out for everyone's smiles. If it *sees* someone who seems down, it gently points them towards a teacher or counselor. This university system is using technology like that to care for its students. What kind of technology would you invent to help your friends feel happier?

Finally, let’s talk about getting your hands dirty and learning! All across China, schools and families *are embracing* something called labor education. This means kids are learning important life skills by doing real, physical work. It's about really **exerting** (using effort/energy) yourself, maybe even sweating a little, and *feeling* proud of what you create! The goal is to build strong bodies and strong minds. This kind of learning *has become* very popular and *is happening* in over 50 cities in China. That’s a huge area, like teaching labor skills in cities all the way from the east coast of the United States to the west coast! Imagine you are outside on a sunny day, your hands are in the soil, planting tiny seeds that will grow into vegetables. Or you and your classmates *are carefully building* a birdhouse, using tools and working together. You can *smell* the fresh earth or the sawdust. You *feel* the tools in your hands. When you finish, there’s a wonderful feeling of accomplishment because you *have made* something real! Labor education is all about understanding the value of hard work and gaining practical skills you can use your whole life. What kind of labor would you like to try with your classmates?

首先，你想象一下，你正津津有味地看电视，突然地面就开始晃动！这件超吓人的事情，最近在南美洲的智利就 **发生** 啦！2025年4月15日，智利北部有个城市叫科皮亚波（一个在南美洲智利北边的城市），那里突然来了一场6.4级的地震。更令人惊讶的是，地震发生时，电视台正在进行一个现场直播节目！大家可以 **看到** 演播室的墙壁在 **剧烈摇晃**，摄像机也 **跟着抖**。电视里的人——一位政客和两位记者——他们看起来既惊讶又有点害怕呢！地面 **不停地颤抖**，他们不得不 **赶紧** 跑出演播室。节目里的设备也 **被震坏** 了一些。这真是普通一天里一个 **意想不到** 的小插曲！6.4级的地震会释放出超大的能量，想想看，演播室里的晃动，感觉就像有五十头大象同时在外面 **用力地** 跺脚一样！你能 **感觉到** 那种震撼吗？如果你当时就在演播室里，你会先做些什么呢？

接下来，咱们去中国看看，有一所大学 **找到** 了一个超级聪明的办法，用科技来帮助同学们保持好心情！西安电子科技大学（一个在中国西安的大大学） **建立** 了一个特别的系统。你可以把它想成是一个特别特别聪明的数字朋友，它会帮忙看看同学们是不是都开开心心的。这个系统使用了叫做算法（就是电脑里那种特别聪明的规则）的技术，去分析很多不同的信息，比如同学们上课的情况怎么样，或者他们参加了什么活动。这能帮助大学 **找到** 那些可能有点不开心或者有烦恼、需要别人 **帮助** 的同学。他们还 **开展** 了很多好玩的活动，比如在“心灵花园”里种绿色植物放松心情，或者把悄悄话写在纸条里放进“树洞漂流瓶”分享自己的想法和感受。这真是关心年轻人的 **新方式**！这个科技系统 **厉害** 得很，找到需要帮助的同学，准确率几乎达到了93%！哇塞，就像考了100道题对了93道一样准，简直不要太厉害！想象一下，你的学校里有一个善良又安静的机器人小助手，它会关注大家的微笑。如果它 **发现** 有人看起来不高兴，就会轻轻地提示他去找老师或者辅导员聊聊天。这个大学的系统就是用科技来这样关心它的同学们。如果你来发明，你会发明什么样的科技来让你的朋友更快乐呢？

最后，我们来聊聊动手实践，让咱们真 **流汗**，真成长！现在，在中国各地，学校和家庭都在 **热烈响应** 一种叫做劳动教育的倡议。这指的是让孩子们通过亲身参与真实的体力劳动来学习重要的生活技能。这要求你真的 **付出** 努力，可能还会出点汗，但你会为自己创造出来东西而 **感到** 骄傲！目的是帮助大家拥有强壮的身体和坚韧的心灵。这种学习有时候安排起来会遇到一些小麻烦，但很多学校都 **克服** 了困难，建立了专门的劳动实践场所，比如小菜园或者手工坊。爸爸妈妈们也 **被鼓励** 在家里让孩子们多做家务。社会也需要提供更多的机会，让年轻朋友们能接触到真正的工作场景。当你亲自动手去劳动，你可以 **闻到** 新鲜泥土或者木屑的味道， **感受** 工具握在手里的感觉。完成后，会有一种特别棒的成就感，因为你 **创造** 了一些真实的东西！劳动教育就是让我们懂得辛勤劳动的价值，并且学会那些能用一辈子的实用技能。这种教育活动现在已经 **遍布** 中国的50多个城市啦！范围超广，就像从中国的最北边到最南边，好多地方的同学们都 **有机会** 一起劳动，是不是 **超级** 棒？ 你最想和同学们一起尝试哪种劳动呢？
