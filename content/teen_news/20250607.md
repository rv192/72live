News Discovery Time! Today, we're going to explore exciting things happening around the world! Get ready for some big news!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

Our first stop is in South America, where the Earth has been moving! Have you ever **felt** the ground shake? In Chile (智利, a country in South America), people recently **saw** a magnitude 6.4 earthquake happen live on TV! Imagine this: you are watching your favorite show, and suddenly, the room starts shaking! The lights swing, things fall off shelves, and everyone looks surprised! This earthquake was strong enough to rock a whole TV studio, making equipment wobble and fall. It's like someone big was shaking a giant dollhouse and everything inside tumbled down. Earthquakes are powerful natural events that happen when the Earth's crust moves. They can happen anywhere, across different continents, even under the sea! People have **seen** them in Asia, Europe, and North America, too. The ground has **been shaking** in many places around the globe. If you were sitting at home and the ground started shaking, what would you do first?

Next, we fly to Asia, to China, where a university is using smart technology to help students **feel** good inside! At Xi'an Electronic Science and Technology University (西安电子科技大学, a university in China), they have **built** a super cool system to look after students' mental health. Mental health is about how we **feel** and think, like feeling happy, sad, or maybe a bit worried. This system uses computers to check lots of information, like how students are doing in their classes or even their sleeping patterns (don't worry, it's private and safe!). They have collected so much data – enough pieces of information to fill about eight school buses! This helps them find students who might be feeling down or having a tough time.

Imagine you have a friendly digital assistant on your phone, like a caring helper, that **knows** when you might need a little extra support just by noticing small signs. The university has **developed** special programs and activities, like fun painting sessions or helpful talks, to give students tools to manage their feelings. They have also **trained** teachers and helpers all over the campus. They have **found** a new way, a new paradigm (/model), to support young people. What kind of helpful friend, human or digital, would you create to help someone who feels lonely or stressed?

Finally, let's think about getting our hands dirty and learning by doing! Across China, schools are focusing more on something called labour education (劳动教育, education about work and labour). This isn't just sitting in a classroom; it's about doing real, physical work! It could be planting vegetables, fixing things, or helping clean up. Many places have **started** building special bases or areas where students can practice. They have **signed** agreements with different groups to create hundreds of places for students to learn through doing.

Imagine you are in a big field, feeling the sun on your skin and the earth in your hands. You are planting tiny seeds or pulling weeds, helping things grow. It's hard work, you might even sweat a lot, but it **feels** good to create something or help keep things clean and tidy. This kind of hands-on work teaches us important lessons, like responsibility, how to work together (cooperation / teamwork), and the value (价值/worth) of effort. They have **seen** students learn so much from these activities. Like planting a small garden that could grow enough yummy tomatoes for 100 salads! This practical learning is a great way to grow strong bodies and strong minds. What hands-on project, like building something or growing food, would you love to try?

That's all for today's news adventure! Keep exploring and learning!

新闻大探索时间到！今天，我们要疾驰探索世界各地发生的激动人心的大事！准备好迎接爆炸新闻吧！

嘣！砰！哇！

我们的第一站要冲向南美洲，那里大地正在跳舞！你有没有亲身感受过地面晃动呢？在智利（Chile, 南美洲的一个国家），大家最近亲眼目睹了一场6.4级地震，它竟然在电视直播时发生了！想象一下：你正在看最喜欢的节目，突然，房间开始剧烈摇晃！灯具晃来晃去，书架上的东西哗啦啦往下掉，所有人都吓了一跳！这场地震的威力简直不要太厉害，它把整个电视演播室都摇得晃晃悠悠，设备也东倒西歪地摔了下来。这就好像一个巨人在摇晃一个大大的玩具屋，里面的东西全都噼里啪啦地倒了！地震是大地母亲发脾气时产生的强大自然现象，当地壳移动时就会发生。它们可能在任何地方发生，跨越不同的大洲，甚至在大海下面也有！人们已经在亚洲、欧洲和北美洲等地亲眼见过地震的威力了。全球各地好多地方的地面都曾颤抖过。如果你坐在家里，突然地面晃动起来，你会第一个做什么呢？

接着，我们飞快地来到亚洲的中国，这里有一所大学正在运用聪明的科技，帮助同学们心情棒棒！在西安电子科技大学（Xi'an Electronic Science and Technology University, 中国的一所大学），他们可是打造了一套超级厉害的系统，来照顾同学们的心理健康。心理健康就是我们感知（feel）和思考的方式，比如开不开心、难不难过，或者是不是有点小担心。这套系统会使用电脑来检查海量信息，比如同学们学习怎么样呀，甚至包括他们的睡眠习惯（别担心，这些信息都是保密又安全的！）。他们已经收集了巨多的数据——这些信息量加起来，简直能装满大约八辆校车呢！这能帮他们找到那些可能情绪低落或者遇到困难的同学。

想象一下，你的手机里有一个友好的电子小助手，就像一个贴心的朋友，它通过注意到一些小小的迹象，就能知道你是不是需要额外的关心和帮助。这所大学已经开发了特别棒的项目和活动，比如有趣的集体绘画，或者非常有用的讲座，给同学们提供了管理情绪的工具箱。他们还训练了学校里的老师和辅导员。他们可是找到了一种全新方式，一种新的方法（paradigm / model），来支持青少年！如果你能发明一个科技小工具来帮助你的朋友，你会让它有什么样的神奇功能呢？

最后，让我们来聊聊亲手实践、流汗学习这件事！在中国各地，学校越来越重视一个叫做劳动教育（labour education, 关于工作和劳动的教育）的东西。这可不是光坐在教室里听课，而是要真正地去动手实践，去付出体力劳动！这可能包括种菜、修理东西，或者帮忙打扫卫生。很多地方都已经开始建设专门的基地或场地，让同学们去真实体验。他们已经和各种单位签订了协议，创建了数百个让同学们通过动手学习的地方！

想象你正站在一片大大的田地里，感受着阳光洒在皮肤上，泥土粘在手里，闻着新鲜泥土的味道，看着植物一点点长大。这可是体力活，你可能会大汗淋漓，但是亲手创造出东西或者让环境变得干净整洁，感觉简直太好了！这种动手实践能教会我们很多重要的道理，比如责任感，如何互相合作（cooperation / teamwork），以及付出努力的价值（value / worth）。他们已经看到同学们从这些活动中学会了好多！就像种一小块地，就能长出够做100份美味沙拉的番茄呢！这种实打实的学习，是让身体强壮、头脑聪明的好方法。你最想尝试什么动手实践的项目呢？比如自己搭建一个东西，或者亲手种植食物？
