**The Amazing Doctor Who Connected Two Worlds**

Have you ever heard a story so powerful it connects people from opposite sides of the world? We have found one about a Canadian doctor named Norman Bethune (诺尔曼·白求恩), and his amazing *legacy/what he left behind* has created a special bond between Canada and China.

Dr. Bethune was a Canadian doctor who traveled to China in 1938 to help during a very difficult time. He wasn't just any doctor; he was a true hero. Imagine you are in a small, old temple from long ago. There are no bright hospital lights, only candles. You can feel the chilly air and hear the sounds of injured soldiers. In this place, busy Bethune worked day and night. The article tells us that in just three months in one area, he performed over 700 surgeries and treated more than 1,000 patients. To understand this number, think about a big school with 1,000 students. Dr. Bethune helped a number of people equal to every single person in that school, in just ninety days! That’s like helping almost 11 people every single day.

He was incredibly clever. Medical supplies were very hard to find, so he had to be creative. He turned an old temple into a hospital. To keep his surgical tools clean and prevent infections, which were very dangerous, he used a simple steel food box to steam them. This simple idea saved many lives. His work has not been forgotten. For many years, people in China have learned about his story in their school textbooks. He has become a symbol of kindness and helping others without asking for anything in return.

Today, this connection is still strong. There are hospitals in China named after him, and people from both Canada and China continue to share his story. A hospital in Shanxi province, where he worked, feels very proud of its name. The doctors and nurses there feel inspired by him and have even traveled to faraway places, like countries in Africa, to offer medical help, just like Dr. Bethune did. This shows how one person’s dedication can *contaminate/spoil* the world with kindness for generations. Dr. Bethune’s story reminds us that compassion has no borders. If you had a special skill, how would you use it to help others, maybe even people in a different country?

**Robots are Serving Dinner and Singing Songs!**

Get ready for a story that sounds like it’s from the future! A brand-new robot-themed restaurant has opened in Beijing’s Yizhuang (亦庄) district, and it's blowing everyone’s mind. A young student named Ma Yuqian visited and was amazed. He saw a robot cut a cake so *precisely/exactly* that it didn’t leave a single crumb behind. How cool is that?

Close your eyes and picture this: you walk into a restaurant. A tall, friendly humanoid robot greets you and mixes a colorful drink. In the corner, a band of robots is playing a cool song. As you eat your hamburger, a robot that looks like a dinosaur walks by and waves at you! This isn't a scene from a movie; it's a real place where you can have lunch. Thousands of people have already visited since it opened. That's like the entire population of a small town lining up to see these amazing machines!

These robots are not just for show. They do almost everything! Humanoid robots act as bartenders, robot bands provide the music, and other robots deliver food and clear tables. You can even see robots making fresh pancakes and coffee right in front of you. The restaurant also has famous historical poets from China, like Li Bai and Su Shi, turned into robots that tell jokes! We have seen robots in factories, but now they are becoming part of our daily fun. This experience shows how technology is making our lives more exciting and entertaining.

The children who visit are having the most fun. They get to see with their own eyes how robots can perform such detailed tasks. It makes them feel like they have stepped into a science fiction world. Seeing these robots work so smoothly can inspire kids to learn more about science, engineering, and programming. The restaurant has given young people a fantastic chance to see the future in action. If you could design a robot for your school, what important job would you want it to do?

**Let's Make Shadows Dance!**

Now for our final story, let’s get creative! In the city of Urumqi (乌鲁木齐), China, a group of children has been learning a very special and ancient art form: shadow puppetry. This is a magical way of telling stories using light and shadows.

What is shadow puppetry? It’s a type of *intangible/something you can't touch* cultural heritage, which means it’s a special tradition passed down through generations. Imagine you are sitting in a dark room. The only light comes from a bright lamp shining on a white screen. Suddenly, you see the shadow of a brave warrior appear! You hear the storyteller’s voice as the puppet fights a mighty dragon. The shadows move and dance, telling an exciting story right before your eyes. The puppets are often made from leather or cardboard and are controlled with thin sticks.

The children in Urumqi have learned how to make their own puppets and bring them to life. This is such a wonderful way to keep an old tradition alive. The puppets can be tiny, just the size of your hand, or as big as a bicycle! The screen they perform on can be as large as your classroom's whiteboard, making the shadows look huge and dramatic. This fun activity helps children use their imagination and learn about their culture at the same time.

And here’s the best part: you can try this at home! You don't need fancy equipment. All you need is a lamp, a white wall, your hands, and maybe some cardboard. You can make simple animal shapes with your hands, or you can cut out a character from cardboard and tape it to a pencil. Shine the light on the wall, put your puppet in between, and start your own shadow show! It’s a great way to be creative and tell your own amazing tales. If you were to create a shadow puppet story, what characters would you make and what adventure would they have?

That’s all for today’s News Discovery Time. We have seen how one person’s goodness can echo across the globe, how robots are becoming our friendly helpers, and how ancient arts are finding new life. Keep exploring, stay curious, and we'll see you next time!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索……砰！啪！哇！

你好，各位了不起的探险家，欢迎来到我们每周一次的新闻大冒险！我是你们的向导，准备好带大家跨越几大洲，穿梭在奇妙的科学和艺术世界里。首先，我们有一个超级感人的故事，关于一位英雄，他的善良连接了北美和亚洲的人们。然后，我们将飞速前往一家未来感十足的餐厅，那里的厨师和表演者都是机器人。最后，我们会聚焦一门古老的艺术，看看孩子们是怎样让它重获新生的。所以，坐稳啦！

**连接两个世界的了不起的医生**

你听过那种能够连接世界两端人们的动人故事吗？我们找到了一个，它关于一位名叫诺尔曼·白求恩（Norman Bethune）的加拿大医生，他留下的宝贵精神在中国和加拿大之间建立了一座特殊的友谊桥梁。

白求恩医生是一位加拿大医生，他在1938年来到中国，在一个非常困难的时期提供帮助。他可不是普通的医生，他是一位真正的英雄。想象一下，你身处一个很久以前的、小小的旧寺庙里。这里没有明亮的医院灯光，只有蜡烛。你能感觉到冰冷的空气，听到受伤战士的声音。就在这样的地方，忙碌的白求恩夜以继日地工作。新闻里说，他在一个地方只待了三个月，就做了700多台手术，治疗了1000多名病人。为了让你明白这个数字有多大，想象一个有1000名学生的大型学校。白求恩医生在短短九十天里，帮助的人数就相当于那所学校里的每一个人！这就像每天帮助将近11个人。简直太牛了！

他非常聪明。当时的医疗用品极度短缺，所以他必须发挥创造力。他把一座古老的寺庙改造成了医院。为了保持手术工具的清洁、防止非常危险的感染，他竟然用一个普通的钢制饭盒来给工具消毒。这个简单的主意拯救了许多生命。他的事迹没有被遗忘。很多年来，中国的孩子们都在课本里学习他的故事。他已经成为了善良和无私奉献的象征。

今天，这份情谊依然非常牢固。中国有以他名字命名的医院，加拿大和中国的人们也都在继续分享他的故事。他工作过的山西省的一家医院，就为自己的名字感到非常自豪。那里的医生和护士们从他身上获得力量，甚至像白求恩医生那样，长途跋涉到很远的地方，比如非洲国家，去提供医疗援助。这说明，一个人的奉献精神可以像种子一样，将善良传播到世界各地，影响一代又一代人。白求恩医生的故事提醒我们，爱心是没有国界的。如果你有一项特殊技能，你会如何用它来帮助他人，甚至是帮助其他国家的人呢？

**机器人正在上菜和唱歌！**

准备好听一个听起来像是来自未来的故事吧！在北京的亦庄（Yizhuang）区，一家全新的机器人主题餐厅开业了，简直让所有人都惊呆了。一位名叫马雨谦的小学生去参观后，感到非常惊讶。他看到一个机器人切蛋糕切得特别精准，连一点碎屑都没掉。这是不是太酷了！

闭上眼睛想象一下这个场景：你走进一家餐厅。一个高大友好的人形机器人向你问好，还为你调制了一杯五颜六色的饮料。在角落里，一个机器人乐队正在演奏一首很酷的歌曲。当你吃着汉堡时，一个长得像恐龙的机器人从你身边走过，还对你挥了挥手！这可不是电影里的画面，这是一个你可以真正去吃午餐的地方。自从开业以来，已经有成千上万的人去参观了。这人数差不多就像一个小镇上的所有人，都排着队去看这些神奇的机器！

这些机器人可不只是为了好看。它们几乎什么都会做！人形机器人当酒保，机器人乐队负责演奏音乐，还有其他机器人在大厅里疾驰，负责送餐和收拾桌子。你甚至可以亲眼看到机器人为你现场制作煎饼和咖啡。这家餐厅里还有以中国古代著名诗人李白和苏轼为原型的机器人，它们会讲笑话呢！我们以前在工厂里见过机器人，但现在它们正在成为我们日常娱乐的一部分。这次体验告诉我们，科技正在让我们的生活变得更加精彩有趣。

来参观的孩子们玩得最开心了。他们亲眼看到了机器人能完成这么精细的任务。这让他们感觉自己好像走进了一个科幻世界。看到这些机器人如此流畅地工作，可能会激励孩子们去学习更多关于科学、工程和编程的知识。这家餐厅给了年轻人一个超棒的机会，去亲身感受未来。如果你可以为你的学校设计一个机器人，你会希望它做什么重要的工作呢？

**让影子跳起舞来！**

现在是我们的最后一个故事，让我们来点有创意的！在中国的乌鲁木齐（Urumqi）市，一群孩子一直在学习一门非常特别又古老的艺术：皮影戏。这是一种用光和影子来讲故事的奇妙方式。

什么是皮影戏呢？它是一种非物质文化遗产，意思是它是一种代代相传的特殊传统，你摸不着它，但能感受到它的魅力。想象你坐在一个漆黑的房间里。唯一的光线来自一盏照在白色幕布上的明灯。突然，你看到了一个勇敢武士的影子出现了！你听到讲故事人的声音，看着那个武士皮影和一条巨龙搏斗。这些影子移动、跳跃，就在你眼前讲述了一个激动人心的故事。皮影通常是用皮革或硬纸板做成的，用细细的杆子来控制。

乌鲁木齐的孩子们已经学会了如何制作自己的皮影，并让它们“活”起来。这真是让古老传统得以延续的一个好办法。皮影可以做得很小，只有你的手那么大，也可以做得像一辆自行车那么大！表演用的幕布可以像教室里的白板一样巨大，让影子看起来又大又有气势。这个有趣的活动能帮助孩子们发挥想象力，同时了解自己的文化。是不是很有意思？

最棒的是：你可以在家尝试一下！你不需要什么高级的设备。你只需要一盏灯、一面白墙、你的双手，或许再来点硬纸板。你可以用手做出简单的动物形状，或者从纸板上剪下一个人物，用胶带粘在一根铅笔上。把灯光照向墙壁，把你的皮影偶放在中间，然后开始你自己的皮影戏吧！这是一个发挥创意、讲述自己精彩故事的好方法。如果要你创作一个皮影戏故事，你会制作哪些角色，他们又会展开怎样的冒险呢？

以上就是今天“新闻探索时间”的全部内容。我们看到了一个人的善良如何在世界范围内产生回响，机器人如何成为我们友好的帮手，以及古老的艺术如何重获新生。请继续探索，保持好奇，我们下次再见！
