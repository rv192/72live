News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

### Amazing Animal Friendship Across Continents

Scientists have discovered something wonderful about penguins and leopard seals in Antarctica. They have seen how these animals, which should be enemies, sometimes interact in surprising ways. Leopard seals have been observed catching penguins and then presenting them as gifts to researchers' cameras! This incredible behavior has been documented by scientists from both Europe and North America who have traveled to the frozen continent.

Imagine you're standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, bundled up in warm clothes. You see a group of penguins waddling near the water's edge. Suddenly, a leopard seal appears! But instead of just hunting, the seal seems to be showing off its catch to the humans watching from nearby boats. The size difference is amazing - a leopard seal can be as long as 3.5 meters, which is about the length of two bicycles placed end to end!

Researchers have felt excited to witness this behavior. They have heard the seals making strange sounds when they approach with their penguin gifts. The seals have appeared to understand that the cameras are recording their actions. What do you think the seals are trying to communicate? Are they just showing off, or could there be another reason for this unusual behavior?

### Space Exploration Reaches New Heights with Student Participation

China has successfully launched a new satellite from the sea near Shandong Province. The Smart Dragon-3 rocket has carried the Geely-05 satellite constellation into its planned orbit. This amazing achievement has marked another step forward in China's space program. What makes this launch special is that students from across the country have been invited to participate in related educational activities.

Imagine you're sitting in a classroom with a live video connection to the launch site. You can feel the excitement building as the countdown begins. You hear the roar of the engines and see the bright flame as the rocket lifts off from the floating platform. The rocket travels at incredible speeds - reaching up to 28,000 kilometers per hour, which is like flying from New York to London in just 30 minutes!

School children have been given the chance to design experiments that could be conducted in space. They have seen their ideas reviewed by scientists and engineers. Some students have even been invited to visit the space center and learn about rocket science firsthand. If you could design an experiment for space, what would you want to study? How would you feel watching your experiment being launched into orbit?

### Ancient Art Meets Modern Creativity

In Zhongxiang City, Hubei Province, master craftsman Yu Dahua has been working to preserve the ancient art of pottery making. This wonderful tradition dates back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties, over 3,000 years ago. Yu has spent more than thirty years perfecting his skills and teaching others about this beautiful art form.

Imagine you're standing beside Yu Dahua in his workshop by the Han River. You can see the clay spinning on the wheel as his skilled hands shape it into a beautiful vase. You hear the soft sound of the wheel turning and smell the earthy scent of wet clay. The workshop contains hundreds of finished pieces, each one unique - enough pottery to fill a small classroom!

Yu has felt it important to pass on his knowledge to younger generations. He has taught many students the basic techniques of pottery making. Children have visited his workshop to try making their own simple pots and bowls. They have discovered the joy of creating something with their own hands.

Would you like to try making pottery? You can start with simple clay that you can buy at craft stores. Begin by making a small pinch pot - just take a ball of clay and push your thumb into the center, then pinch and shape the sides as you slowly turn it. Remember to be patient and have fun! What would you create if you could work with clay for a day?

### 跨越大洲的奇妙动物友谊

科学家们在南极洲发现了关于企鹅和豹海豹的奇妙现象。他们观察到这些本应是天敌的动物有时会有令人惊讶的互动方式。豹海豹被捕捉到捕捉企鹅后，竟然把它们作为"礼物"送到研究人员的摄像机前！这一不可思议的行为已经被来自欧洲和北美洲的科学家记录下来，他们远赴冰封大陆进行这项研究。

想象你正站在南极洲冰冻的海岸上，穿着厚厚的保暖衣物。你看到一群企鹅在水源附近摇摇摆摆地行走。突然，一只豹海豹出现了！但不仅仅是捕猎，这只海豹似乎还向附近船上观看的人类展示它的"战利品"。体型差异令人惊叹 - 一只豹海豹可以长达3.5米，这相当于两辆自行车首尾相连的长度！

研究人员对目睹这种行为感到兴奋不已。他们听到海豹带着企鹅"礼物"靠近时发出奇怪的声音。海豹似乎明白摄像机正在记录它们的行为。你认为海豹想要传达什么信息？它们只是在炫耀，还是这种不寻常的行为背后有其他原因？

### 学生参与航天探索达到新高度

中国在山东省附近海域成功发射了一颗新卫星。智能龙三号火箭已将吉利-05卫星星座送入预定轨道。这一惊人成就标志着中国航天计划又向前迈进了一步。这次发射特别之处在于，全国各地的学生被邀请参与相关的教育活动。

想象你坐在教室里，通过实时视频连接到发射现场。你能感受到倒计时开始时兴奋的气氛。你听到引擎的轰鸣声，看到火箭从浮动平台上发射时的明亮火焰。火箭以令人难以置信的速度飞行 - 高达每小时28,000公里，这就像从纽约飞到伦敦只需30分钟！

学校孩子们有机会设计可以在太空中进行的实验。他们看到自己的想法被科学家和工程师审查。一些学生甚至被邀请参观航天中心， firsthand学习火箭科学知识。如果你能为太空设计一个实验，你想研究什么？看到你的实验被发射到轨道，你会有什么感受？

### 古代艺术与现代创意的碰撞

在湖北省钟祥市，制陶大师余大华一直致力于保护古老的制陶艺术。这一美妙的传统可以追溯到商周时期，距今已有3000多年历史。余大师花了三十多年时间完善他的技艺，并向他人传授这门美丽的艺术。

想象你站在汉江边的余大华工作坊里。你看到泥土在转盘上旋转，他熟练的双手将其塑造成一个美丽的花瓶。你听到转盘转动的轻柔声音，闻到湿泥土的泥土气息。工作坊里有数百件成品，每一件都独一无二 - 足够的陶器可以填满一个小教室！

余大师觉得将他的知识传授给年轻一代很重要。他教过许多学生制陶的基本技巧。孩子们参观过他的工作坊，尝试制作自己简单的罐子和碗。他们发现了用自己的双手创造东西的乐趣。

你想尝试制作陶器吗？你可以从工艺品店购买的简单粘土开始。先制作一个小捏罐 - 只需拿一团粘土，用拇指按入中心，然后慢慢转动时捏塑边缘。记住要有耐心，玩得开心！如果你能用粘土创作一天，你会制作什么呢？简直不要太有趣！
