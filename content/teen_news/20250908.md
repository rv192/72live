Ethan flew his plane all the way from North America to Antarctica, which is near South America. This journey covered more than 15,000 kilometers - that's like flying around 380 basketball courts placed end to end! Imagine you are standing on the icy white land of Antarctica, surrounded by penguins and seals, with the cold wind blowing against your face. What would you feel if you were exploring this frozen continent? Ethan has now been released after his adventure and can return home.

Technology has made our lives easier, and now you can build your own robot helper! Chinese researchers have created an amazing project called XLeRobot. This robot can clean tables, water plants, and even play with cats! The best part? It only costs 3,999 yuan to build - that's about the same price as 40 basketballs! Imagine you are in your room, with robot parts spread around you, as you assemble your very own helper. What would you make your robot do first? This open-source project means anyone can learn how to build it, and maybe you could be the next young inventor to create something incredible!

Lights, camera, action! A Chinese actress named Xin Zhilei has won the Best Actress award at the Venice International Film Festival! She starred in a movie called "Sun Hanging High" and became the first Chinese actress born in the 1980s to win this prestigious award. Imagine you are walking on the red carpet in Venice, with cameras flashing all around you and people cheering your name. What would you say in your acceptance speech? Xin Zhilei worked very hard and traveled from a small city called Hegang in China to the famous film festival in Italy. Her story shows that with dedication, dreams can come true! If you're interested in acting, why not try making a short film with your friends? You could use your phone camera and create your own movie magic!
