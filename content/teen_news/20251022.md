News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! A powerful typhoon and a super-smart school revolution!

First up, we have some wild, windy weather news. A huge storm named Typhoon Fengshen is making its way across the South China Sea. This is the 24th typhoon of the year 2025, and it has already grabbed everyone's attention. The National Meteorological Center (the organization that watches our weather) has issued a blue alert because Fengshen is getting stronger. Right now, it’s a tropical storm with winds blowing at 82.8 kilometers per hour. That’s already pretty fast!

But it’s not planning to stay that way. Forecasters have seen that the storm is expected to move northwest and `gradually/slowly` intensify into a severe tropical storm or even a powerful typhoon. This means its wind speeds could reach up to 126 kilometers per hour! To give you an idea, that’s faster than most cars are allowed to drive on a highway. On top of that, a cold front is moving in from central and eastern China. When this cold air meets the warm, wet air of the typhoon, it's like a big atmospheric battle! This combination will bring even stronger winds and much more rain to coastal areas in Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces.

Imagine you are standing on a beach, but safely inside a strong building. You can hear the howling wind that sounds like a giant wolf, and you see the massive waves crashing onto the shore. The sky has turned a dark, moody gray. The rain isn't just dripping; it feels like the sky is pouring giant buckets of water everywhere. That’s what it might feel like. The weather center has warned that some areas, especially northern Taiwan, could get 100 to 200 millimeters of rain. The wettest places might even see over 250 millimeters! To picture that, 250 millimeters of rain is like pouring 250 big one-liter water bottles over a single one-meter square of ground. That's enough water to completely fill a small bathtub in that tiny space! It's a massive amount of water, which is why everyone has been told to be very careful. If you knew a typhoon was on its way, what three essential things would you prepare to keep your family safe and comfortable?

Next, we are shifting gears from the sky to the classroom for some amazing news about technology. Beijing has become the very first region in China to make artificial intelligence, or AI, education `compulsory/required` for all students in primary and secondary schools. This is a huge step!

This semester, more than 1,400 schools across the city have started this new program. Every student, from the first grade all the way to senior high school, will have at least eight class hours dedicated to learning about AI. This isn't just a small club; it's a core part of their education. Let's think about that number. If we estimate that each of those 1,400 schools has about 1,000 students, that means over 1.4 million students are learning about AI right now! That’s more people than the entire population of some small countries!

So what do these classes look like? Let's take a peek inside Haidian District Experimental Primary School. Here, the learning journey has been designed to be super fun and interactive. First graders start with the very basics, just learning what AI is. As they get older, they learn `foundational/basic` principles. By the time they are in the upper grades, students are actually creating their own smart hardware applications. They use tools like block-based programming, which is like building with digital LEGOs, and special iFlytek (a famous Chinese AI company) robots that can recognize images.

Picture this: You are in a bright, colorful classroom. In front of you are robot parts, wires, and a tablet. You drag and drop a few colorful blocks of code on your screen, press a button, and the small robot you just built whirs to life! Its eyes light up, and its little clamp moves to pick up a ball. You have just told a machine exactly what to do. How cool is that!

We have even heard from some of the students. A sixth-grader named Miao Ruoyi, who is 11, said she finds programming a bit challenging but loves building the robots with her hands. She feels a great sense of accomplishment when her robot, with its clamps and rollers, is finished. Another student, Fang Xi, who is 12, has already won awards in competitions. He feels that learning AI and coding is actually more straightforward than his other school subjects! The goal of these classes is not to turn every student into an AI expert. Instead, it's about helping everyone understand and use AI confidently, preparing them for a future where humans and machines will work together. If you were in an AI class, would you prefer designing the robot's "brain" with code, or building its body with your hands? What makes that choice more interesting for you?

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索……砰！啪！哇！一个威力巨大的台风和一场超级智能的校园革命！

首先，我们来关注一条关于大风大雨的天气新闻。一个名叫“风神”的巨大风暴正在中国南海海域上行进。这是2025年的第24号台风，它已经成功吸引了所有人的目光。国家气象中心（也就是负责观测我们国家天气情况的机构）已经发布了蓝色预警，因为“风神”的力量正在变强。目前，它是一个热带风暴，风速达到了每小时82.8公里。这个速度已经相当快啦！

但它可不打算就此罢休。气象预报员已经观测到，这个风暴预计会向西北方向移动，并逐渐增强为一个强热带风暴，甚至是一个威力强大的台风。这意味着它的风速可能会达到每小时126公里！给你一个概念，这比大多数汽车在高速公路上允许行驶的速度还要快。最重要的是，一股冷空气正从中国中东部地区过来。当这股冷空气和台风带来的温暖、潮湿的空气相遇，简直就像一场大气层里的大对决！这种结合会给福建、广东和海南等沿海地区带来更猛烈的狂风和更多的降雨。

想象一下，你正安全地待在一栋坚固的房子里，朝外望向海滩。你能听到狂风像巨狼一样在嚎叫，还能看到巨大的海浪猛烈地拍打着海岸。天空已经变成了一片阴沉的深灰色。雨水不是一滴一滴地落下来，而是感觉天空像是在用巨大的水桶到处泼水。这可能就是身处其中的感觉了。气象中心已经发出警告，一些地区，特别是台湾北部，降雨量可能会达到100到200毫米。降雨最多的地方甚至可能超过250毫米！为了让你能想象出来，250毫米的降雨量，就相当于把250个大号的一升水瓶，全部倒在一平方米的地面上。这点儿地方的水，就足够灌满一个小孩的浴缸了！这水量简直不要太大了，所以每个人都被告知一定要特别小心。如果你知道台风要来了，你会准备哪三样最重要的东西来保护家人安全舒适呢？

接下来，我们把目光从天空转向教室，来看一条关于科技的超棒新闻。北京已经成为中国第一个在所有中小学全面开设人工智能（简称AI）必修课的地区。这可是了不起的一大步！

从这个学期开始，全市超过1400所学校都启动了这个新项目。每一个学生，从小学一年级到高中，每学期都将拥有至少8个课时专门学习人工智能。这可不是一个小小的兴趣小组，而是他们教育的核心部分。我们来算一下这个数字，如果这1400所学校，每所学校大约有1000名学生，那就意味着有超过140万名学生正在学习AI！这个数字比一些小国家的总人口还要多呢！

那么，这些课到底是什么样子的呢？让我们去海淀区实验小学偷偷看一眼。在这里，学习之旅被设计得超级有趣，互动性十足。一年级的小同学从最基础的知识开始，先了解AI是什么。随着年龄增长，他们会学习一些基本原理。到了高年级，学生们就已经在亲手创造自己的智能硬件应用了。他们使用的工具有图形化编程，就像搭数字乐高积木一样，还有能识别图像的科大讯飞（中国一家著名的人工智能公司）机器人。

想象一下这个场景：你坐在一间明亮多彩的教室里。你面前不是只有书本，而是摆满了机器人零件、电线和一个平板电脑。你在屏幕上拖动几个彩色的代码块，按一下按钮，你刚刚亲手组装的小机器人就“嗖”地一下活了过来！它的眼睛亮了起来，小小的机械爪开始移动，夹起了一个小球。你刚刚成功地指挥了一台机器。简直酷毙了！

我们甚至还采访了几位同学。一位叫缪（miào）若伊的六年级同学，她11岁，说她觉得编程有点挑战，但她特别喜欢亲手组装机器人。当她看着自己做的、带着爪子和滚轮的机器人完工时，她感到非常有成就感。另一位12岁的同学方曦（xī），已经在比赛中获奖了。他觉得学习AI和编程，其实比学其他文化课更直接、更容易！这些课程的目标，并不是要把每个孩子都培养成AI专家，而是为了帮助每个人都能自信地理解和使用AI，为他们未来与机器合作的时代做好准备。这可不是闹着玩的！如果你也在上AI课，你会更喜欢用代码设计机器人的“大脑”，还是亲手搭建它的身体呢？为什么呢？
