## Amazing Northern Lights Dance Across Two Continents

Have you ever seen the Northern Lights? A spectacular time-lapse video has captured the magnificent aurora borealis over the North Sea. The video was filmed from Flamborough in East Yorkshire, UK, and shows the stunning natural phenomenon that lasted for three hours and forty minutes. Scientists have explained that this rare display was visible from both Europe and parts of North America, making it a cross-continental light show!

The Northern Lights stretched across the sky, covering an area as large as 15,000 football fields. Imagine you're standing on a cliff overlooking the dark sea, with green and purple lights dancing above you like magical ribbons. The lights have been described as nature's own fireworks, and people who have seen them say they feel a special connection to our planet.

What would you do if you had the chance to see the Northern Lights? Would you take pictures, or just enjoy the moment with your eyes?

## AI Changes How Companies Work, Even Kids Can Learn!

Technology is changing our world quickly. A big company called Salesforce has started using AI Agents to help with work. This change has led to 4,000 workers losing their jobs, but the CEO says humans and AI should work together, each doing half of the work.

Some schools have even started teaching students how to work with AI, preparing them for future jobs. Kids as young as ten years old are learning to program simple AI tools in computer clubs.

Think about it: if you could create your own AI helper, what would you want it to do for you? Would it help with homework, clean your room, or maybe play games with you?
