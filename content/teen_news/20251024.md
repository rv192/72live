News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore… Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello, fellow explorers, and welcome back to our weekly news roundup! I’m your host, ready to share some amazing stories. First, we’ll travel to a special museum where history is being rebuilt by hand. Then, we will visit a famous red building where young people are making history come alive!

Our first stop is the Qinghua University Science Museum. Now, this isn't just any museum. It is the first comprehensive, collection-based science museum in the country, and it has a truly inspiring story. The museum director, Wu Guosheng, has said that when they started, they had almost nothing—no money, no staff, and no items! But they had a big dream: to create a home for scientific treasures. So, they started from scratch.

How do you build a museum with over 8,000 items from nothing? The team has used a clever three-part plan: collect, buy, and create. First, they collected old instruments from around the university campus and asked students and teachers to donate what they had. One of the most precious pieces they have received is a "high-pressure sterilizer." A professor brought it all the way from America in 1946 to help China's science advance. Then, they used funds to buy important scientific items from overseas.

But the most exciting part is "create." The team has been working hard to make replicas of famous historical inventions. This is very difficult because it’s not just about making something look old. They have to work exactly like the originals! For example, they tried to recreate an old electricity machine made by Francis Hauksbee. They faced a strange problem: their machine didn't produce as much static electricity as the old one. After much research, they discovered that modern glass is too pure! It doesn't have the little impurities that help create static electricity. So, what did they do? They learned the ancient way to make glass, creating a new glass ball that was perfectly imperfect for the job. How cool is that? This shows their dedication to being truly *authentic* /real.

They have also built a full-scale, fully functional replica of the "Water-Powered Astronomical Clock Tower" from the Northern Song Dynasty, which was made over 1,000 years ago. This huge machine was one of the greatest *achievements* /successes of ancient Chinese technology. If you lined up 8,000 science books, that might give you an idea of how many stories this museum holds. Seeing this clock tower helps young people feel proud of their history and inspires them to innovate.

Imagine you are standing in their workshop. You can see the dedicated team carefully piecing together parts of an ancient calculator. You can smell the wood and metal they are working with, and you can feel the excitement in the air as they get closer to making history work again. If you could recreate any ancient invention, what would it be and why?

Our second story takes us to a beautiful, historic building in Beijing: the Red Building of Peking University. This place has always been important, but recently, it has become a buzzing hub for young people. It feels like the old walls are hearing new, energetic voices!

Since reopening in 2021, the Red Building has welcomed almost 500,000 visitors each year. And here’s the amazing part: more than half of them are under 30 years old! That's about 250,000 young people a year. It's like the entire population of a small city, filled with young, curious minds, visiting this single place every year. This shows that history is not boring at all; it’s actually a huge magnet that *attracts* /draws in people our age.

So, what makes it so popular? The museum has made sure that history feels personal and engaging. Picture this: you are walking through the restored office of Li Dazhao, a famous historical figure. You see the desk with its ink, brush, and paper, arranged just as they were over a century ago. Then you enter the second reading room, where Mao Zedong once worked. The tables and chairs look the same as they did back then. You can almost feel the serious atmosphere and hear the quiet turning of newspaper pages. It’s like you have traveled back in time.

The museum has also developed different programs for different ages. For university students, there are deep-dive study tours. For middle school students, they have created special ceremonies to make the experience more *significant* /important. And for elementary school students, they have fun learning courses. Everyone finds a way to connect with the stories of the past.

But the most inspiring part is how young visitors have transformed from listeners into storytellers. The Red Building has formed a "New Youth Volunteer Service Team" with 330 student volunteers. Together, they have contributed over 40,000 hours of service. That’s equal to one person working nonstop, 24 hours a day, for more than four and a half years! These busy bees buzz with passion, sharing stories in a way that other young people can understand and enjoy. A student volunteer named Tian Zichong said that their goal is to make history "come alive and move." They don't just recite facts; they share a *mission* /task to keep the spirit of the past alive. If you were a volunteer guide there, what part of the story would you be most excited to share with visitors?

That’s all for today’s News Discovery Time. Until next time, stay curious!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索……砰！啪！哇！

你好啊，各位探索家，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报！我是你的主持人，准备好分享一些超棒的故事啦。首先，我们会去一个特别的博物馆，那里的历史是靠双手重建的。然后，我们会探访一座著名的红楼，看看那里的年轻人是怎么让历史鲜活起来的！

咱们的第一站是清华大学科学博物馆。这可不是一个普通的博物馆哦。它是国内第一个收藏型、综合类的科学博物馆，而且它的故事简直不要太励志！馆长吴国盛教授说，刚开始的时候，他们几乎什么都没有——没钱、没人、也没东西！但他们有一个伟大的梦想：为科学珍宝们建造一个家。于是，他们就这样白手起家了。

怎么才能从零开始，建成一个拥有超过8000件藏(cáng)品的博物馆呢？团队用了一个聪明的“三步走”计划：收集、购买和创造。首先，他们在清华校园里收集旧仪器，还号召老师和同学们捐赠。他们收到的一件非常珍贵的宝贝是一个“高压灭菌器”。一位教授在1946年，把它大老远地从美国带回来，就是为了让中国的科学研究能跟上世界的脚步。然后，他们用筹集到的钱从国外买回了一些重要的科学文物。

不过，最酷的部分还是“创造”。团队一直努力复原历史上著名的发明。这可难了，因为不光要样子像，功能上还得和原版一模一样！比如说，他们尝试复原一台由弗朗西斯·霍克斯比制造的古老起电机。他们遇到了一个奇怪的问题：他们的新机器产生的静电远不如旧的好。研究了好久，他们才发现，原来现在的玻璃太纯净了！因为缺少能帮助产生静电的微小杂质。那怎么办呢？他们就去学习古老的玻璃吹制(chuī zhì)方法，造出了一个“不完美”却又正合适的玻璃球。这简直太神了！这正说明了他们追求真实的工匠精神。

他们还一比一全功能复原了1000多年前北宋的“水运仪象台”。这个巨大的机械装置，是中国古代科技最伟大的杰作(jié zuò)之一。想象一下，把8000本科学书排成一排，大概就能感受到这个博物馆里藏着多少故事了。看到这个复原的钟楼，能让年轻人为自己的历史感到骄傲，并激励他们去创新。

想象一下，你正站在他们的工作室里。你能看到专注的团队成员，正小心翼翼地拼装着一个古代计算器的零件。你能闻到空气中木头和金属的味道，还能感受到当他们快要让历史“活”过来时的那种激动心情。如果你可以复原一件古代的发明，你会选择什么呢？为什么？

我们的第二个故事，将带我们去北京一栋漂亮又充满历史感的建筑：北京大学红楼。这个地方一直都很重要，但最近，它成了一个年轻人聚集的热闹中心。感觉这些古老的墙壁，都听到了全新的、充满活力的声音！

自从2021年重新开放以来，北大红楼每年接待近50万名参观者。最神奇的是：其中一半以上的人都不到30岁！也就是说，每年大约有25万名年轻人来这里。这就像一个小型城市的所有人口，带着满满的好奇心，在一年内都来参观了这个地方。这说明历史一点也不枯燥，它其实像一块巨大的磁铁，吸引着我们这个年纪的人。

那它为什么这么受欢迎呢？原来，纪念馆想了很多办法，让历史变得亲切又好玩。想象这个场景：你正走在李大钊先生复原的办公室里，他是一位著名的历史人物。你看到书桌上的笔墨纸砚，摆放得和一百多年前一模一样。接着你走进毛泽东曾经工作过的第二阅览室，桌椅都保持着当年的模样。你几乎能感受到那严肃的氛围，听到报纸被轻轻翻动的声音。这体验，简直是穿越了！

纪念馆还为不同年龄段的参观者设计了不同的活动。对大学生，有深度的研学考察；对中学生，他们设计了特别的仪式，让整个体验更有分量；而对小学生，则有寓教于乐的趣味课程。每个人都能找到和过去的故事产生共鸣的方式。

但最鼓舞人心的，是年轻的参观者们如何从聆听者转变为讲述者。北大红楼组建了一支“新青年志愿者服务队”，现在已经有330名学生志愿者了。他们共同贡献了超过4万小时的服务时间。这相当于一个人不吃不喝不休息，连续工作四年半！这些勤劳的“小蜜蜂”们充满热情，用年轻人更能理解和喜欢的方式，分享着这里的故事。一位名叫田子翀(chōng)的学生志愿者说，他们的目标是让历史“活起来、动起来”。他们不只是背诵知识点，更是承担起一种使命，让过去的精神传承下去。如果你是那里的一名志愿讲解员，你最想和游客分享哪一段故事呢？

今天的新闻探索时间就到这里啦。下次再见，要一直保持好奇心哦！
