## English Version

News Discovery Time! Let's explore some amazing things happening around the world! (Bang! Pop! Wow!)

First up, get ready for a wild ride! A paraglider pilot in China, **Peng Yujiang** (彭玉江 - a paraglider pilot in China), has had an unbelievable adventure high in the sky. While testing new gear over the **Qilian Mountains** (祁连山脉 - mountains in northwestern China), he was suddenly pulled upwards by a super strong wind current, a rare natural event sometimes called a 'cloud suck'. He started at about 3,000 meters high, which is like climbing 10 Eiffel Towers! But then, this powerful wind has pulled him up, up, up, all the way to an incredible 8,500 meters! Wow! That's almost as high as the very peak of Mount Everest!

Imagine being there: You are in the sky, floating peacefully, when suddenly you feel a huge force pulling you straight up! You are soaring faster and faster. Everything around you turns white and cold as you enter a thick cloud. It's freezing, maybe around minus 40 degrees Celsius – colder than the coldest winter day you can imagine! You can't see anything, you feel dizzy and you might even be spinning! Your heart is beating super fast. He has recorded his experience on his camera, and the video has gone viral online! It has shown his face covered in ice crystals. He has said it was super scary, with very little oxygen way up there. He just wanted to come down quickly but couldn't control it.

Peng Yujiang has survived this incredible journey, and his story has reminded us how powerful nature can be! It also shows how brave people are when facing the unexpected. He has had to use all his skills to try and regain control of his paraglider in the freezing, thin air. It was a challenging moment for sure!

If you were unexpectedly pulled up so high into the sky, what would you think about? What would you try to do to stay calm and safe?

Moving from natural wonders to cool tech! Have you ever dreamed of controlling a robot in a fight? Well, that's happening right now at the **CMG World Robot Competition Series** (CMG世界机器人大赛·系列赛 - a cool robot sports event)! This event in Hangzhou, China, is the first ever fighting competition just for humanoid robots. Teams get to control awesome robots like the **Unitree G1** (宇树G1 - the name of a type of robot).

Let's check out the stats! The Unitree G1 robot is about 1.3 meters tall, which is taller than most big dogs and about the height of a young teenager! It weighs about 35 kilograms, maybe like carrying two medium-sized dogs at once! It has 29 different joints, called degrees of freedom (**DOFs**), which help it move smoothly and do lots of actions like punching and kicking. The matches are exciting, with 3 rounds, each lasting 2 minutes. Points are given for hitting the head, body, or legs. A really important rule is that if a robot falls down, it only has 8 seconds to stand back up! This tests how robust (/strong) the robots are – how well they can handle hits and still work.

Imagine you are sitting there with the control stick in your hands. Your robot opponent is across the arena, ready! The bell rings! You push the joystick, and your robot throws a jab! Swish! The other robot tries to kick! You quickly make yours block! It's a fast-paced game of skill, not just for the robots, but for the human controllers too! Right now, humans are controlling these robots with joysticks, kind of like playing a video game in real life! Experts say that building robots that can fight completely by themselves, using their own 'brains' to see, think, and move, might take another 5 years or even more. So, human control is a big part of the fun now!

This is a great example of how technology and sports are coming together. Controlling robots takes concentration and skill! What if you could control a robot using *your* own movements, like in a motion capture game? If you could design a fighting robot, what unique special moves or cool abilities would it have?

And finally, let's talk about tasty traditions! This week in China, it's a double celebration for kids because **Children's Day** (儿童节 - a special day for kids, June 1st) and the **Dragon Boat Festival** (端午节 - a traditional Chinese festival, usually in late May or June) have happened close together! In a kindergarten in Beijing, kids have been getting ready for these fun days by doing a special activity: making **zongzi** (粽子 - a traditional food made of sticky rice).

Data point for you: Kids in Beijing, China, have prepared for two wonderful holidays happening almost at the same time this week!

Imagine you are sitting at a big table with your classmates and teachers. There are piles of fresh green leaves, yummy sticky rice, and different fillings like sweet beans or meat. You pick up a leaf, fold it carefully to make a pocket, spoon in the rice and filling, then fold the leaf again and tie it tightly with string. Your fingers are sticky, and the air smells like the fragrant leaves and delicious rice! Everyone is laughing and helping each other. Making zongzi is a fun way to learn about tradition and work together. These zongzi will be steamed and enjoyed, maybe during the festival! It's a delicious part of the Dragon Boat Festival, which also involves dragon boat races!

Doing hands-on activities like making zongzi is a wonderful way to connect with culture and have fun with friends and family. It's also a great way to practice being careful and patient. Why not try making a traditional craft or food from your culture, or maybe even learn one from another country?

What is your favorite part about festivals and celebrations? Is it the food, the games, the time with family, or something else?

That's all for our news today! Keep exploring the amazing world around you!

新闻发现时间到！今天，我们要狂奔着去探索世界上发生的超精彩大事！(Bang! Pop! Wow!)

头条新闻，准备好迎接一场惊心动魄的空中大冒险吧！在中国，一位名叫 **彭玉江**（Peng Yujiang - 一位滑翔伞飞行员）的飞行员，在天上经历了一次让人难以置信的旅程。他在 **祁连山脉**（Qilian Mountains - 中国西北部的一座山）上空测试新装备时，突然被一股超级猛烈的风向上卷起，这是一种叫做“积雨云吸力”的奇特自然现象。他一开始在大概3000米高的地方，这就像把10个埃菲尔铁塔叠起来那么高！但是，这股强大的风竟然把他唰地一下，一直拉到了8500米的高空！天哪！这简直要不要太厉害了！这个高度差不多都快到世界最高峰珠穆朗玛峰的顶上了！

想象一下你在那个地方：你正在天空中，轻轻地飘着，突然感觉到一股巨大的力量把你往上拉！你越飞越快，越飞越高。周围的一切都变成了白色，越来越冷，因为你钻进了一朵厚厚的云里面。外面冷得不得了，可能有零下40摄氏度——比你经历过的最冷的冬天还要冷好几十倍！你什么都看不见，感觉晕头转向，可能还在不停地转圈！你的心扑通扑通跳得飞快。他用身上的相机记录下了这个过程，视频在网上火得一塌糊涂！视频里，他的脸上都结满了冰晶。他说当时可怕极了，在高高的天上氧气非常稀薄，他想赶紧降下来，但是根本控制不住。

彭玉江叔叔在这次不可思议的空中旅行中平安回来了，他的故事让我们再次感受到大自然的力量太强大了！也让我们看到了人们在面对突发情况时的勇敢。他当时肯定使出了浑身解数，想在又冷又稀薄的空气里重新控制住滑翔伞。那真是个巨大的挑战啊！

如果你突然被这样高高地卷上天，你会想些什么呢？你会怎么努力让自己保持冷静和安全呢？

接下来，我们从奇妙的大自然转到超酷的科技世界！你有没有梦想过控制一个机器人打架？嗯，这个梦想正在变成现实，就在 **CMG世界机器人大赛·系列赛**（CMG World Robot Competition Series - 一个很酷的机器人体育赛事）的擂台上！这个比赛在中国杭州举行，是全球第一个专门为人形机器人举办的格斗比赛。参赛队伍可以控制像 **宇树G1**（Unitree G1 - 一种机器人的名字）这样超棒的机器人！

快来看看机器人的参数吧！宇树G1机器人身高大约1.3米，比大部分大狗狗都要高，差不多就是一个少年人的身高啦！它体重大概35公斤，可能跟你抱着两只中等大小的狗狗一样重！它有29个可以活动的关节，叫做自由度（**DOFs**），这让它可以灵活地移动，做出很多动作，比如出拳和踢腿。比赛可刺激了，有3个回合，每个回合2分钟。打中头部、身体或者腿部都会得分，打中腿得分更高哦。还有一个超级重要的规则是，如果机器人倒地了，它只有8秒钟的时间站起来！这考验的是机器人有多“鲁棒”（/结实）——就是它能承受住打击，还能继续工作的能力！

想象一下你手里握着控制手柄。你的机器人对手站在擂台对面，准备好了！铃声一响！你推动操纵杆，你的机器人就挥出了一拳！嗖！对方的机器人想踢腿！你快速让自己的机器人闪躲！这简直就是一场速度超快、考验技术的比赛，不仅考验机器人，也考验操控它的人！现在，人们就是这样用摇杆来控制这些机器人，有点像在现实世界里玩电子游戏！专家说，要让机器人完全靠自己打架，用自己的“大脑”去看、去想、去行动，可能还需要至少5年甚至更长时间。所以，现在人类控制是比赛的一大看点！

这真是科技和运动结合得太好了！控制机器人需要很专注，还要有技巧！如果你可以用你自己的动作来控制机器人，就像玩体感游戏那样，那会是什么感觉？如果你能设计一个格斗机器人，你想给它什么样的特殊招式或者超酷的技能呢？

最后，我们来聊聊美味的传统吧！这周在中国，小朋友们可是双喜临门哦！因为 **儿童节**（Children's Day - 专门为小朋友设立的节日，6月1日）和 **端午节**（Dragon Boat Festival - 中国的一个传统节日，通常在五月末或六月）正好挨得特别近！在北京的一所幼儿园里，小朋友们一直在忙着为这两个快乐的节日做准备，他们做了一件特别有意义的事：包 **粽子**（zongzi - 一种用糯米做的传统食物）！

给你们一个数据点：中国北京的小朋友们，这个星期正忙着为两个马上就要到来的超棒节日做准备！

想象一下你坐在一个大大的桌子边，旁边是你的同学和老师们。桌上放着一堆堆新鲜的绿叶子，香喷喷的糯米，还有各种好吃的馅儿，比如甜甜的豆沙或者咸咸的肉馅。你拿起一片叶子，小心地把它折成一个口袋，用勺子舀进糯米和馅料，再把叶子折起来，用绳子紧紧地绑好。你的手指头有点粘粘的，空气里飘着叶子和米饭的香味，闻起来真不错！大家都在开心地笑着，互相帮忙。包粽子是一个特别有趣的活动，能学到传统文化，还能和小伙伴、老师一起动手合作。这些包好的粽子会被蒸熟，可能在节日的时候一起分享！这是端午节非常有代表性的一道美食，端午节还有赛龙舟的活动呢！

像包粽子这样自己动手做的活动，是体验文化和和朋友家人一起开心的超棒方式。它也能让你练习细心和耐心。你也可以试试看，有没有什么你自己文化里的传统手工艺或者美食可以亲手做一做，或者学习一个其他国家的也可以哦！

你在节日和庆祝活动里，最喜欢的是什么呢？是好吃的东西，好玩的游戏，和家人在一起的时间，还是别的东西呀？

今天的少年新闻就到这里啦！继续探索你身边这个精彩的世界吧！
