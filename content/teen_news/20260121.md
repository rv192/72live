## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring three amazing stories that will make you think about animals, space, and friendship in new ways!

### Story 1: The Clever Cow Who Uses Tools

Imagine a cow that scratches herself with a broom, just like you might scratch your back with a ruler! Scientists in Austria have discovered something incredible about a cow named Veronika.

Veronika lives in a peaceful mountain village in Austria. For years, she has been teaching herself to use sticks, rakes, and brooms as scratching tools. But here's what really amazed the researchers: Veronika uses different parts of the same tool for different jobs!

When she needs to scratch a tough spot on her back, she uses the bristle end of the broom. But when she wants to gently scratch her soft belly, she flips the broom around and uses the smooth wooden handle instead!

Dr. Antonio Osuna-Mascaro from the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said: "We were not expecting cows to be able to use tools. Until now, this kind of clever tool switching has only been seen regularly in chimpanzees."

This discovery is groundbreaking! Even though humans have lived alongside cattle for about 10,000 years, this is the first time scientists have officially recorded a cow using tools. It suggests cows may be much smarter than we ever imagined.

Veronika's farmer, Witgar Wiegele, hopes her story will inspire people to appreciate nature more. As he says: "Save nature, then you protect yourself. Nature's diversity is the key to survival on this planet."

Think about it: What other animals around you might be smarter than we realize?

### Story 2: China's Space Companies Reach for the Stars

Did you know that rockets can launch from private companies, not just governments? In 2025, China's commercial space companies set an exciting record!

These private space companies successfully launched 50 rockets in just one year! That's almost one rocket every week! This is a huge jump from previous years and shows how fast China's private space industry is growing.

These rockets aren't just flying into space for fun. They're carrying satellites that help with weather forecasting, internet connections, and even studying our planet from above. Some companies are also working on rockets that can be reused, just like SpaceX does in America.

Picture this: In 2015, China's private space industry barely existed. Ten years later, it's launching 50 rockets annually! Young engineers and scientists, some not much older than your teachers, are designing these amazing machines.

The most exciting part? Many of these companies are hiring young people with fresh ideas. Students studying engineering, physics, and computer science today might be the ones launching rockets tomorrow!

Can you imagine: What would you send into space if you could design a satellite?

### Story 3: A Boy's Six-Year Promise of Friendship

In China, there's a 13-year-old boy named Wu Yajun whose story is touching hearts across the nation. Every single day for six years, he has been helping his classmate who has a disability get to school, eat lunch, and move between classes.

It all started when Wu Yajun was just 7 years old. He noticed his classmate needed help, and instead of looking away, he stepped forward. Rain or shine, hot summers or freezing winters, he never missed a day.

"He's my friend," Wu Yajun simply explains. "Friends help each other."

Every morning, Wu Yajun arrives at school early to help his friend settle in. During lunch, he makes sure his friend can eat comfortably. Between classes, he helps him move from room to room. This isn't a task assigned by teachers, it's a choice made by a young heart full of kindness.

His dedication has earned him recognition, but Wu Yajun says the real reward is seeing his friend smile. Teachers say his actions have inspired other students to be more helpful and caring toward classmates who need support.

Here's something to think about: What small act of kindness could you do for someone at your school tomorrow?

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要探索三个精彩故事，它们会让你对动物、太空和友谊有全新的认识！

### 故事一：会使用工具的聪明奶牛

想象一下，有一头奶牛会用扫帚给自己挠痒痒，就像你可能会用尺子挠背一样！奥地利的科学家发现了一头名叫维罗妮卡的奶牛，她的行为令人难以置信。

维罗妮卡住在奥地利一个宁静的山村里。多年来，她一直在自学如何使用树枝、耙子和扫帚作为挠痒痒的工具。但真正让研究人员惊叹的是：维罗妮卡会用同一个工具的不同部位来完成不同的任务！

当她需要挠背上比较硬的地方时，她会用扫帚的刷毛那一端。但当她想轻轻地挠柔软的肚子时，她会把扫帚翻过来，用光滑的木柄那一端！

维也纳兽医大学的安东尼奥·奥苏纳-马斯卡罗博士说："我们没想到奶牛会使用工具。到目前为止，这种聪明的工具切换行为只在黑猩猩身上被经常观察到。"

这个发现具有开创性意义！尽管人类与牛共同生活了大约一万年，但这是科学家首次正式记录到奶牛使用工具。这表明牛可能比我们想象的要聪明得多。

维罗妮卡的农场主维特加尔·维格勒希望她的故事能激励人们更加珍惜大自然。他说："保护自然，就是保护你自己。大自然的多样性是我们在这个星球上生存的关键。"

想一想：你身边还有哪些动物可能比我们意识到的更聪明呢？

### 故事二：中国航天公司向星空进发

你知道火箭可以由私人公司发射，而不仅仅是政府吗？2025年，中国的商业航天公司创造了一个令人振奋的纪录！

这些私人航天公司在一年内成功发射了50枚火箭！这几乎是每周发射一枚！这比前几年有了巨大的飞跃，显示了中国民营航天产业增长的速度有多快。

这些火箭不只是为了好玩才飞上太空。它们携带的卫星可以帮助天气预报、互联网连接，甚至从太空研究我们的地球。一些公司还在研发可以重复使用的火箭，就像美国的SpaceX一样。

想象一下：2015年，中国的民营航天产业几乎不存在。十年后，它每年发射50枚火箭！年轻的工程师和科学家，有些年纪比你的老师大不了多少，正在设计这些了不起的机器。

最令人兴奋的是什么？许多这些公司正在招聘有新想法的年轻人。今天学习工程、物理和计算机科学的学生，明天可能就是发射火箭的人！

你能想象吗：如果你能设计一颗卫星，你会把什么送上太空？

### 故事三：一个男孩六年的友谊承诺

在中国，有一个13岁的男孩叫吴亚军，他的故事正在感动全国人民。六年来，他每天都在帮助一位有残疾的同学上学、吃午饭、在教室之间移动。

这一切始于吴亚军7岁的时候。他注意到他的同学需要帮助，没有视而不见，而是主动上前。无论刮风下雨，酷暑寒冬，他从未缺席过一天。

"他是我的朋友，"吴亚军简单地解释道，"朋友之间就是要互相帮助。"

每天早上，吴亚军都会提前到学校，帮助他的朋友安顿下来。午餐时，他确保他的朋友能够舒适地吃饭。课间，他帮助他从一个教室移动到另一个教室。这不是老师布置的任务，而是一颗充满善意的心做出的选择。

他的坚持为他赢得了认可，但吴亚军说真正的回报是看到他的朋友微笑。老师们说，他的行为激励了其他学生更加乐于助人，更加关心需要帮助的同学。

想一想：明天你可以为学校里的某个人做什么小小的善举呢？
