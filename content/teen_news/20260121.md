**News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring five amazing stories from around the world!**

### Story 1: The Clever Cow That Uses Tools

Imagine a cow that can scratch itself using sticks and brooms - just like you might use a back scratcher! Scientists in Austria discovered an incredible cow named Veronika who has learned to use tools in ways never seen before in cattle.

Veronika lives on a mountain farm and has figured out something remarkable. When she needs to scratch a tough spot on her back, she uses the bristle end of a broom. But when she wants a gentler touch on her sensitive belly, she flips the broom around and uses the smooth handle instead!

This kind of smart behavior has only been seen consistently in chimpanzees before. Dr. Antonio Osuna-Mascaro from Vienna said, "We were not expecting cows to use tools as multipurpose tools."

**Think about it:** What other animals do you think might be smarter than we realize?

### Story 2: A Teenager's Six-Year Promise of Friendship

In China, a 13-year-old boy named Wu Yajun has been helping his disabled classmate every single day for six years. Since they were in first grade, Wu Yajun has carried his friend's backpack, helped him navigate stairs, and made sure he never felt alone at school.

Their friendship shows us that true heroes don't need superpowers - they just need kind hearts. Wu Yajun says he never thought twice about helping his friend because "that's what friends do."

**Data point:** Studies show that having supportive friends can improve academic performance by up to 25%!

**Think about it:** How can you be a better friend to someone who might need extra help?

### Story 3: Shenzhou XX Returns Safely to Earth

China's Shenzhou XX spacecraft capsule successfully returned to Earth after spending 270 days in orbit! The astronauts completed numerous experiments and faced challenges including debris impacts during their mission.

The return capsule landed safely in Inner Mongolia, marking another milestone for China's space program. Interestingly, the retired extravehicular spacesuit also returned to Earth on this mission for scientific study.

**By the numbers:** The spacecraft traveled approximately 180 million kilometers during its mission - that's like going around Earth 4,500 times!

**Think about it:** Would you want to be an astronaut? What experiment would you conduct in space?

### Story 4: China Launches Emergency Management University

A brand new university dedicated to emergency management has officially opened in China! This specialized school will train future professionals who respond to natural disasters, fires, and other emergencies.

Students will learn everything from rescue techniques to disaster prevention planning. The university represents China's commitment to building a safer society through education.

**Think about it:** What skills do you think emergency responders need most?

### Story 5: Banks Launch Satellites Into Space

Several major Chinese banks have launched their own satellites into space! These satellites will help banks monitor loan projects, track collateral assets, and even provide emergency financial services during natural disasters.

The satellites are part of China's growing commercial space industry. They can take high-resolution images that help banks verify construction progress with over 95% accuracy.

**Cool fact:** The satellites orbit Earth at about 500 kilometers altitude - that's higher than the International Space Station!

**Think about it:** How else might satellites help businesses in the future?

**新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索来自世界各地的五个精彩故事！**

### 故事一：会使用工具的聪明奶牛

想象一下，一头奶牛能用棍子和扫帚给自己挠痒痒——就像你用痒痒挠一样！奥地利的科学家发现了一头名叫维罗妮卡的神奇奶牛，她学会了以前从未在牛身上见过的使用工具的方式。

维罗妮卡住在一个山区农场，她发现了一些了不起的事情。当她需要挠背上比较难挠的地方时，她会用扫帚的刷毛那一端。但当她想轻柔地挠敏感的肚子时，她会把扫帚翻过来，用光滑的手柄那一端！

这种聪明的行为以前只在黑猩猩身上持续观察到过。维也纳的安东尼奥·奥苏纳-马斯卡罗博士说："我们没想到奶牛会把工具当作多用途工具来使用。"

**想一想：** 你认为还有哪些动物可能比我们想象的更聪明？
