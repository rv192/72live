## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring some incredible stories from our amazing planet and beyond!
[Bang! Pop! Wow!]

First up, have you ever seen the sky light up with dancing colors? People on different continents have been seeing something truly spectacular and a little mysterious lately! Scientists have reported unusual aurora (Or-RAW-ruh / 极光) sightings in places far from the North and South Poles where they normally appear. Think about Australia, for example, which is usually too far from the South Pole to see these amazing light shows easily! At the same time, bird watchers across Europe and North America have noticed strange changes in bird migration (MY-grate / 迁徙) patterns. Birds are busy flying, but sometimes in surprising new directions!

Scientists have been studying why this is happening. They say the unusual aurora activity has covered an area bigger than the entire country of India! That's a lot of sky glowing green, purple, and pink! Bird experts have also reported seeing specific bird flocks flying hundreds, or even thousands, of kilometers differently than they have for many years. This big, beautiful, and slightly mysterious event has caught everyone's attention.

Imagine standing under the night sky, maybe near a quiet beach in Australia, and seeing bright, shimmering green and purple waves dancing above you, where you've only ever seen stars before. Or imagine watching a group of birds you see every year suddenly turn and fly east instead of south! What could be causing these strange sights and surprising trips? Is it linked to changes in Earth's magnetic field, or something else?

Why is this all happening at the same time? If you were a scientist, what mysterious (mis-TEE-ree-us / 神秘的) puzzle would you try to solve first?

Next, prepare for some super exciting news about kids reaching for the stars! Guess what? Children like you are helping scientists explore space! The space agency NASA (NA-SA / 美国太空总署) has a special program where students from different schools can design tiny science experiments (ex-PAIR-i-ment / 实验). These experiments are then sent up very high into Earth's atmosphere, sometimes even into space, on special balloons or small rockets!

It's been a huge success! Over 7,000 students from across the country have participated in this program this year. Their creative and innovative (IN-oh-vay-tiv / 创新的) experiments have collected an incredible amount of data – enough data to fill 25,000 standard school notebooks if you wrote it all down! That shows just how amazing the ideas from young minds can be! The data they've helped collect is helping scientists understand more about our planet's atmosphere and what happens up high.

Picture a classroom buzzing with excitement. You and your friends are gathered around a table, carefully building a tiny box, placing small sensors and other pieces inside. You imagine your creation floating high above Earth, feeling the cold, thin air, seeing the blue planet curved below, doing its important job. It's like your ideas have taken a trip to space! It's a chance to feel connected to big discoveries.

If you could design *any* experiment to send into the sky or to space, what amazing thing would you want to discover? What question about Earth or the stars would *you* try to answer?

Finally, let's travel way, way back in time through amazing art! Scientists in a hidden cave in France have made a fascinating (FAS-in-nay-ting / 引人入胜的) discovery – really old paintings made by people who lived long, long ago! These aren't just simple drawings; they are incredible artworks that tell us stories about the lives of our ancestors (AN-ses-ter / 祖先).

These amazing cave paintings (Kave PAYN-ting / 岩画) are over 18,000 years old! Can you imagine? That’s much, much older than the pyramids in Egypt! Scientists have carefully explored the cave and have found over 400 different images painted or carved onto the rock walls. The paintings show animals like horses, bison, and deer, as well as strange symbols. They used colors made from natural minerals, like reds and blacks, painting with their fingers or simple tools.

Imagine carefully walking into a deep, quiet cave. The air is cool and still. You shine your light onto the wall and see pictures of animals drawn with simple, strong lines. You can almost feel the presence of the ancient artists who stood in that very spot thousands of years ago, patiently creating their art in the flickering light of a fire. These pictures have survived for so long, waiting for us to find them.

What stories do *you* think these ancient pictures are trying to tell us? What was life like for the people who drew them? And what story would *you* paint or draw if you wanted to share something important about your life today?

Here’s a fun idea: Grab some paper and crayons or pencils! Try drawing a picture about your day, or about an animal you like, but only use simple shapes and colors, like the ancient artists did! See what kind of story you can tell without using lots of details!

That's all for News Discovery Time today! Keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep discovering!

新闻发现时刻！今天我们要一起探索，在我们这个神奇地球和更远的地方发生的超酷事情！
[Bang! Pop! Wow!]

首先，大家有没有见过会在天上跳舞的颜色呀？最近，不同大洲的人们都看到了一些特别壮观、有点神秘的景象！科学家叔叔阿姨们报告说，平时只在地球最北边或最南边附近出现的极光（JI-guang / Aurora），竟然跑到了离那里很远的地方“玩耍”，比如澳大利亚！澳大利亚通常离南极太远了，不容易看到这么美的极光表演！与此同时，在欧洲和北美洲，爱看鸟的叔叔阿姨们发现，好多小鸟的搬家路线（qian-XI / migrate）也变得怪怪的。鸟儿们还是忙着飞来飞去，但有时候会飞到意想不到的新方向！

科学家们一直在研究这是为什么。他们说，这次能看到不寻常极光的区域，面积比整个印度还要大一圈！哇，这片天空闪耀着绿色、紫色、粉色的光，简直不要太厉害！鸟类专家们也报告说，有些特定鸟群的飞行路线，跟过去很多年相比，竟然改变了几百甚至几千公里！这个又大、又美、又有点神秘的事件，引起了好多人的关注。

想象一下，你站在澳大利亚的海边，抬头看夜空。平时漆黑一片的天空，竟然闪烁着明亮的、波浪一样的绿色和紫色的光芒，在你眼前跳舞！或者，想象你看到一群每年都按时搬家的小鸟，突然转个弯，往东边飞走了，而不是往南边！是什么原因让天空和鸟儿都变得这么奇怪呢？是不是和地球的磁场变化有关，还是有别的原因？

为什么这些事会同时发生呢？如果让你来当科学家，这个神秘的（shen-MI-de / mysterious）大谜团，你最想先解开哪一部分呀？

接着，准备好迎接一个超级棒的消息吧！跟小太空探险家们有关哦！你们知道吗？像你们一样的小朋友们，正在帮助科学家探索宇宙呢！美国的太空总署（NASA）（NA-SA / 美国太空总署）有一个很棒的项目，让不同学校的学生们可以设计小小的科学实验（shi-YAN / experiment）。这些实验会被装在特别的气球或者小火箭上，飞到地球大气层很高的地方，有时候甚至能摸到太空的边边！

这个项目超级成功！今年，全国有七千多个小朋友参加了这个活动。他们那些充满创意和创新的（chuang-XIN-de / innovative）实验，收集到了多得不得了的数据——如果把这些数据都写在纸上，能装满两万五千本学校里用的那种标准笔记本！这说明小朋友的脑袋瓜里装着多么厉害的点子！他们帮忙收集的数据，正在帮助科学家们更了解地球的大气层，和高高天空发生的事情。

想象一下，教室里热热闹闹的，你和同学们围在一起，小心翼翼地搭建一个小盒子，把小小的传感器和其他零件放进去。你幻想你的这个“作品”正飘在地球很高的地方，感受着冰冷稀薄的空气，看着弯弯的蓝色地球就在下面，努力完成着它重要的工作。感觉就像你的点子去太空旅行了一样！这是一个和伟大发现连接在一起的机会。

如果你也能设计一个飞向天空或者太空的实验，你最想发现宇宙的什么惊人秘密呀？关于地球或者星星，你最想解答哪个问题呢？

最后，让我们一起坐上时光机，去看看很久很久以前的世界吧！在法国的一个藏起来的洞穴里，科学家们有了一个引人入胜的（yin-REN-ru-SHENG-de / fascinating）发现——一些非常非常古老的画，是很久很久以前住在这里的人们画的！这些可不是普通的画哦，是我们的老祖先（ZU-xian / ancestor）们，用笨拙但充满智慧的手，画在石头墙壁上的艺术品！

这些神奇的岩画（Yan-HUA / cave painting）已经有一万八千多岁啦！能想象吗？比埃及的金字塔还要老得多！科学家叔叔阿姨们小心地探索了洞穴，发现了四百多幅不一样的图画或者刻痕。画里有马、野牛、鹿等动物，还有一些奇怪的符号。他们用的颜色是用大自然的矿物做的，比如红色和黑色，可能是用手指或者简单的工具画出来的。

想象你弯着腰，轻轻地走进一个又深又安静的洞穴。里面的空气凉凉的，静悄悄的。你用手电筒照亮墙壁，哇！看到上面画着好多简单但充满力量的动物图画。你几乎能感觉到，几千年前，那些古老的艺术家就站在这里，借着火光，耐心地创作着他们的艺术品。这些画经历了这么久的时间，一直在这里等着我们去发现。

你觉得这些古老的图画，想告诉我们什么故事呢？画它们的人，他们的生活是什么样的呀？如果让你画一幅画，分享你今天的一件重要事情，你会画些什么呢？

这里有个好玩的小建议：快去拿一张纸和彩色笔吧！试着学学那些古人，只用简单的形状和颜色，画一幅画，讲讲你今天的故事试试看！

今天的“新闻发现时刻”就到这里啦！大家都要继续探索，继续提问，继续去发现哦！
