**(Intro Music Fades In and Out)**

**Host:** News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore...

**(Sound Effects: Bang! Pop! Wow!)**

**Host:** ...glowing forests, smart recycling apps, and giant digital art! Hello everyone, and welcome to our weekly news express. I'm your host, Alex. Let's jump right in!

Our first story has come from the deep, dark jungles of South America. Scientists have recently discovered a new species of glowing mushroom in a remote part of the Amazon Rainforest (the world's largest tropical rainforest). These fantastic fungi have a special ability called bioluminescence, which means they can produce their own light, just like fireflies! The discovery is very exciting because this particular type of mushroom creates a constant, soft green glow. Researchers have reported that these mushrooms grow in large clusters. At night, they illuminate the forest floor with a beautiful, magical light.

Imagine this: you are walking through the jungle after sunset. It's completely dark, and you can hear the strange sounds of night animals. Suddenly, you see a gentle green light ahead. As you get closer, you realize the light is coming from hundreds of mushrooms covering the ground and tree trunks. The glowing area is huge, covering a space as big as 30 school classrooms put together! Scientists believe the light might attract insects to help spread the mushroom's spores. They have collected samples to study this *fascinating/very interesting* phenomenon further. This discovery shows us that our planet still has so many secrets to reveal. If you could discover a new glowing creature, what would you name it?

Next up, we are blasting off into the world of technology, where some brilliant young minds have made a big difference. A team of three middle school students from California has won the National "Tech for Tomorrow" competition! Their winning project is an amazing new smartphone app they called "Recycle Right." The students have been working on this project for over six months. They felt frustrated when they saw people throwing recyclable items into the wrong bins. So, they decided to create a solution.

Here is how their *innovative/new* app works. Picture this: you are holding an empty yogurt cup and you don't know if it's recyclable. You just open the "Recycle Right" app, use your phone's camera to scan the item's barcode or shape, and instantly, the app tells you exactly how and where to recycle it. It even shows a map to the nearest recycling center! The app's design is very simple and easy to use. Since launching it in their school a month ago, the app has already helped students and their families correctly recycle over 5 tons of waste. That’s about the weight of a large elephant! The student team has said they feel very proud and hope their app can be used in more cities. If you could build an app to solve one problem at our school, what would it do?

**(Short musical transition)**

For our final piece of news, we are diving into the world of art and culture. A stunning new public art piece has just been unveiled in a city park in Chicago. It's called the "Symphony of Spheres," and it’s not just a sculpture you look at—it's one you can play with! This massive *installation/art piece* consists of fifty large, glowing orbs of different sizes. These spheres are scattered across a huge lawn, creating a dreamlike landscape.

During the day, the spheres have a smooth, white surface that reflects the sky. But when the sun goes down, they come alive with light and sound. Each sphere is interactive. When you touch one, it lights up with a *vibrant/bright* color and plays a musical note. If many people touch different spheres at the same time, they create a beautiful harmony of light and music together! The entire installation covers an area equal to two professional basketball courts. Imagine you are there on a cool evening. You can see families running between the spheres, hear the happy sounds of laughter and music, and feel the creative energy all around you. The artists who created it have said they wanted to bring people together to create something beautiful. It’s a perfect example of how technology can create new ways for us to have fun and connect with each other. What kind of interactive art would you love to see in our town?

That's all the time we have for today. Thanks for tuning in to News Discovery Time. Stay curious, and see you next week!

  **（开场音乐淡入淡出）**

**主持人：** News Discovery Time！今天我们要探索...

**（音效：Bang! Pop! Wow!）**

**主持人：** ...会发光的森林、聪明的回收APP，还有巨大的数字艺术！大家好，欢迎收听本周的新闻快报。我是你们的主持人，小艾。让我们马上冲向今天的新闻现场！

我们的第一条新闻来自南美洲深邃（suì）幽暗的丛林。科学家们最近在亚马逊雨林（世界上最大的热带雨林）的一个偏远地区，发现了一种全新的会发光的蘑菇。这些奇特的菌类拥有一种叫做“生物发光”的特殊本领，意思就是它们能自己产生光，就像萤火虫一样！这次的发现简直不要太厉害了，因为这种特别的蘑菇能持续散发出柔和的绿色光芒。研究人员报告说，这些蘑菇都是一大片一大片地生长。到了晚上，它们就用美丽又神奇的光照亮了森林的地面。

想象一下这个场景：太阳下山后，你正在丛林里穿行。四周一片漆黑，你还能听到夜行动物发出的奇怪叫声。突然，你看到前方有一片温柔的绿光。你走近一看，才发现光是从成百上千个蘑菇那里发出来的，它们长满了地面和树干。这片发光的区域非常大，面积相当于30个学校教室拼在一起那么大！科学家们认为，这种光可能是为了吸引昆虫来帮助它们传播孢（bāo）子。他们已经收集了样本，来进一步研究这个有趣的现象。这个发现告诉我们，我们的地球上还有超多秘密等着我们去揭开呢。如果你发现了一种新的发光生物，你会给它取个什么名字呢？

**（短暂的音乐过渡）**

接下来，我们要飞速进入科技的世界，那里有一些聪明的同龄人做出了巨大的改变。一个由三名加州中学生组成的小队，赢得了全国“科技创想未来”大赛的冠军！他们获奖的项目是一个超棒的手机应用程序，名字叫“回收通”。为了这个项目，同学们已经努力了超过六个月。当看到人们把可回收物扔进错误的垃圾桶时，他们感到很苦恼。于是，他们决定自己动手创造一个解决方案。

这个创新的APP是这样工作的。你想象一下：你手里拿着一个喝完的酸奶杯，不确定它能不能回收。你只需打开“回收通”这个APP，用手机摄像头扫描一下条形码或者物品的形状，APP立刻就会告诉你应该怎么回收、扔到哪里去。简直太方便了！它甚至还会显示一张地图，告诉你最近的回收中心在哪儿。这个APP的设计非常简洁，用起来很容易。自从一个月前在他们学校推出以来，这个APP已经帮助同学和家人们正确回收了超过5吨的废品。这差不多是一头大象的重量了！这个学生团队说，他们感到非常自豪，并希望他们的APP能在更多的城市里被使用。如果你可以创造一个APP来解决我们学校的一个问题，你会做什么呢？

**（短暂的音乐过渡）**

最后一条新闻，我们来沉浸（jìn）在艺术和文化的世界里。最近，芝加哥的一个城市公园里揭幕了一件令人惊叹的全新公共艺术品。它的名字叫“光球交响曲”，而且它不只是一个给你看的雕塑——你还能和它一起玩！这个巨大的艺术装置由五十个大小不一的发光球体组成。这些球体散落在宽阔的草坪上，创造出一种如同梦境般的景象。

白天，这些球体表面光滑洁白，能倒映出天空的影子。但当太阳下山后，它们就会被灯光和声音唤醒。每一个球体都是可以互动的。当你触摸其中一个，它就会亮起一种鲜艳（yàn）的颜色，并播放一个音符。如果很多人同时触摸不同的球体，他们就能共同创造出一曲由光影和音乐构成的美丽合奏！整个装置的占地面积相当于两个专业篮球场那么大。想象一下，在一个凉爽的傍晚你就在那里。你能看到一家人开心地在球体间奔跑，听到欢快的笑声和音乐声，感受到周围充满的创造力。创作它的艺术家们说，他们希望把人们聚集在一起，共同创造美好的事物。去现场打卡肯定超酷的！这真是个绝佳的例子，告诉我们科技如何为我们创造新的方式来娱乐和互动。你希望在我们的城市里看到什么样的互动艺术呢？

今天的时间就到这里了。感谢收听“News Discovery Time”。保持好奇心，我们下周再见！
