News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring global nature wonders, space technology, and amazing bridges! Bang! Pop! Wow!

Scientists from Asia and Europe have discovered an amazing connection between Earth and the Moon! Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have proposed that extra argon-40 gas found on the Moon might have traveled there from Earth carried by solar winds. Imagine standing on the Moon's surface, looking back at our blue planet, knowing that tiny particles from Earth's atmosphere have made this incredible journey across space! The Moon and Earth are located on two different continents - well, celestial bodies - but they're connected in ways we're just beginning to understand. This discovery helps us learn more about how planets and moons exchange materials, which is super important for future space exploration. If you could collect something from Earth to send to the Moon, what would you choose?

China has successfully launched another group of low-Earth orbit satellites! On September 28, 2025, China sent up the 11th set of satellites for their internet constellation using an improved Long March-6 rocket. These satellites have now reached their planned orbits. This was the 597th mission for the Long March rocket family - that's like launching rockets almost every single day for nearly two years! What's even more exciting is that students from Beijing No. 4 Middle School have participated in tracking these satellites as part of their science club project. Imagine sitting at your computer and receiving real-time data from satellites flying hundreds of kilometers above Earth! These satellites will help provide internet access to remote areas around the world. Have you ever thought about how the internet reaches places with no cables or cell towers?

The world's highest bridge has become a magnet for extreme sports lovers! The Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge in Guizhou, China, stands 625 meters above the river below - that's taller than two Eiffel Towers stacked on top of each other! Last week, 31 top athletes from 21 countries and regions, including China, Russia, and Italy, gathered for the International High Bridge Extreme Sports Invitational. They performed incredible jumps and stunts on this amazing bridge. Imagine standing at the edge of this massive structure, feeling the wind rush past as you prepare for an unforgettable leap! The bridge stretches 2,890 meters long with a main span of 1,420 meters, making it not only the highest bridge in the world but also the one with the largest span in mountainous areas. If you had the chance to visit this incredible bridge, would you want to watch the extreme sports or try one yourself?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索全球自然奇观、太空科技和惊人桥梁！砰！嘭！哇！

来自亚洲和欧洲的科学家们发现了地球与月球之间惊人的联系！中国科学院的研究人员提出，月球上发现的过量氩-40气体可能是由太阳风从地球带到月球的。想象一下，你站在月球表面，回望我们的蓝色星球，知道来自地球大气层的微小颗粒已经穿越太空完成了这段不可思议的旅程！月球和地球位于两个不同的大陆——嗯，天体——但它们的连接方式我们才刚刚开始理解。这一发现帮助我们更多地了解行星和卫星如何交换物质，这对未来的太空探索超级重要。如果你能从地球上收集一样东西送到月球，你会选择什么呢？

中国成功发射了又一批低地球轨道卫星！2025年9月28日，中国使用改进的长征六号运载火箭发射了互联网星座的第11组卫星。这些卫星现已进入预定轨道。这是长征系列运载火箭的第597次任务——这相当于近两年内几乎每天都发射火箭！更令人兴奋的是，北京第四中学的学生作为他们科学俱乐部项目的一部分参与了追踪这些卫星。想象一下坐在电脑前，接收来自地球上方数百公里飞行的卫星的实时数据！这些卫星将帮助为世界偏远地区提供互联网接入。你有没有想过互联网是如何到达没有电缆或信号塔的地方的？

世界最高桥已成为极限运动爱好者的磁石！位于中国贵州的花江大峡谷桥高出河面625米——这相当于两个埃菲尔铁塔叠在一起的高度！上周，来自21个国家和地区的31名顶尖运动员，包括中国、俄罗斯和意大利的选手，齐聚一堂参加国际高桥极限运动邀请赛。他们在这座令人惊叹的桥梁上完成了令人难以置信的跳跃和特技表演。想象一下站在这座巨大结构的边缘，感受风儿呼啸而过，为一次难忘的跳跃做准备！这座桥长2890米，主跨1420米，使其不仅是世界最高的桥梁，也是山区跨度最大的桥梁。如果你有机会参观这座令人难以置信的桥梁，你是想观看极限运动还是亲自尝试一项呢？
