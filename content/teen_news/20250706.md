## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today, we're exploring some splashing news from a famous river, how young people are helping villages bloom, and hearing ancient melodies come back to life! Bang! Pop! Wow!

Let's dive right in! For the first time in 100 years, swimmers have been able to splash and play in the **River Seine** (塞纳河 Sài'nà Hé - a famous river in Paris, France)! Since 1923, swimming has been banned because the water was too dirty. But before the big **Paris 2024 Olympics** (巴黎2024年奥运会 Bālí èrlíngèr sì nián Àoyùnhuì - a huge sports event held in Paris), they spent a massive amount of money cleaning it up – over **€1.4 billion** (£1.2 billion; $1.6 billion). That’s like gathering enough pocket money from every single kid in a big country for *years*! Or, put another way, it's equivalent to buying **140 million brand-new soccer balls**!

Now, there are three special spots along the river where people can swim safely. Imagine standing on the bank near the **Eiffel Tower** (埃菲尔铁塔 Āifēi'ěr Tiětǎ - a very tall metal tower in Paris) or the **Notre Dame Cathedral** (圣母院 Shèngmǔyuàn - a famous old church in Paris). You can see the sparkling clean water and feel the excitement as people jump in! Each spot has changing rooms and places to lay out your towel, big enough for hundreds of sunny swimmers. It’s a brilliant, brave step to bring the river back to the people. Clean water brings fresh, flowing fun!

It took lots of hard work and incredible effort to make this happen. Scientists and engineers worked tirelessly to reduce **pollution** (污染/contamination) and harmful **bacteria** (细菌/germs) in the water. They *have used* smart techniques to filter the water and stop dirty water from getting in. The city *has waited* a whole century for this moment!

If you could swim in any famous river in the world, which one would you choose and why? Would you pick a busy city river like the Seine, or maybe a wild river in nature?

Next up, let's travel to China, where brilliant young minds are helping villages sparkle! A competition called the **National College Student Rural Revitalization Competition** (全国大学生乡村振兴大赛 Quánguó Dàxuéshēng Xiāngcūn Zhènxīng Dàsài - a big competition where university students help villages improve) *has launched*! Hundreds of students from all over China are visiting villages like those in **Saltpan County** (盐边县 Yánbiān Xiàn - a place in China) to help make them better places to live. They are using their clever ideas and knowledge to solve real problems in the countryside.

These students aren't just sitting in classrooms. They are walking through farms, visiting local workshops, and talking to villagers to understand their needs. For example, in one village, they started a project called "Book for Veggies," where people can exchange donated books for fresh vegetables. It’s been a huge success! They've received over **12,000 donated books**, which is more books than in **ten school libraries combined**! And they've exchanged over **30 tons of vegetables** – that's like filling a giant school bus with carrots and potatoes!

Imagine walking with a group of bright students through a sunny village, seeing them talk to farmers about new ways to grow food or helping design a fun new spot for kids to play. They are bringing fresh energy and innovative (创新的/new) ideas to rural areas. They are exploring everything from cool new farm products like spicy pepper beer made with local ingredients, to finding ways to share local culture. It shows how powerful young people can be when they put their minds to helping others.

This competition encourages students to implement (实施/carry out) their ideas and see the positive changes they can make. It’s all about bringing new life and opportunity through rural **revitalization** (乡村振兴 xiāngcūn zhènxīng - making villages better and full of life again).

If you could invent something or start a project to help your community, what would it be? Would you clean up a park, help older neighbors, or maybe start a cool recycling program?

Finally, let's listen closely as ancient sounds fill the air! At **Hebei University** (河北大学 Héběi Dàxué - a university in China), amazing researchers and students *have spent* almost **30 years** working like detectives to bring back ancient Chinese music. For hundreds or even a thousand years, many old songs and tunes were written down in special musical codes that nobody knew how to read anymore. It was like having treasure maps, but not knowing how to follow them!

But this dedicated team has been working hard to figure out these old codes. They have translated over **7,000 ancient music scores** (乐谱/sheet music)! That’s enough sheet music to fill a whole room from floor to ceiling! It was a super tricky task because they needed to understand not just the music notes, but also the ancient words and poems that went with them. They’ve bravely broken codes that were preserved (保存/kept safe) for ages!

Now, thanks to their incredible work, this ancient music is starting to be heard again. Some of the tunes are being used in video games, so young players can accidentally hear music from long ago! Other songs are being performed live, bringing historical harmonies back to the stage.

Close your eyes and imagine hearing music that hasn't been played for centuries, like a hidden treasure suddenly making beautiful sounds again. It’s truly magical how studying the past can create something wonderful for today. This research shows that even things that seem forgotten can be brought back to life with curiosity and hard work!

Maybe you could try listening to some traditional music from different cultures, or even try learning a simple instrument! If you could learn or bring back any ancient art or skill, what would it be? Would you learn ancient painting, sword fighting, or maybe how to build something incredible without modern tools?

That's all the news for today! See you next time for more amazing discoveries!

新闻发现时间！Bang! Pop! Wow! 今天我们要一起狂奔探索奇妙的水上冒险，看聪明的小脑袋如何助力乡村，还有古老的音乐怎样重新发出光彩！

咱们立刻出发！一件超棒的事发生在法国巴黎的**塞纳河**（Sài'nà Hé - 巴黎一条著名的河）！时隔整整100年，人们终于可以再次在河里游泳、玩水啦！从1923年起，塞纳河就禁止游泳了，因为水太脏了。但在盛大的**巴黎2024年奥运会**（Bālí èrlíngèr sì nián Àoyùnhuì - 在巴黎举办的一个大型体育活动）之前，他们投入了超级多的钱来清理河水——超过**14亿欧元**！这笔钱简直不要太多了！打个比方，这相当于买下**1亿4千万个崭新的足球**那么多钱！

现在，塞纳河边有三个专门的地方可以安全游泳了。想象一下，你正站在河边，旁边就是闪闪发光的**埃菲尔铁塔**（Āifēi'ěr Tiětǎ - 巴黎很高的一座铁塔）或古老的**圣母院**（Shèngmǔyuàn - 巴黎一座有名的老教堂）。你看着干净闪亮的水，感受着百年后第一批游泳的人跳进水里的兴奋！每个游泳点都有换衣服的地方，还有能铺几百条毛巾的大空地。让河流重新回到人们身边，这真是个了不起又勇敢的行动。干净的河水带来快乐又畅快的玩耍！

为了实现这个目标，大家付出了艰苦卓绝的努力。科学家和工程师们夜以继日地工作，想办法减少水里的**污染**（wūrǎn - 让水变脏的东西）和有害的**细菌**（xìjūn - 一种很小的微生物）。他们用了很多聪明的技术来过滤河水，不让脏东西进去。这座城市为了这一刻，可是**等待**了整整一个世纪呀！

如果是你，想在哪条世界闻名的河里游泳呢？为什么呀？你会选择像塞纳河这样的热闹城市里的河流，还是大自然里奔腾的野性河流呢？

接下来，咱们一起到中国看看，那里有群厉害的年轻人正在帮助乡村变得更漂亮！一个叫做**全国大学生乡村振兴大赛**（Quánguó Dàxuéshēng Xiāngcūn Zhènxīng Dàsài - 大学生帮助乡村发展的比赛）的活动**启动**啦！来自全国各地的几百名大学生，跑到像**盐边县**（Yánbiān Xiàn - 中国的一个地方）这样的乡村，用他们的聪明才智帮助村子解决难题，让乡村**焕然一新**！

这些大学生可不是只坐在教室里。他们**走访**田间地头，参观当地的工厂，还跟村民们聊天，了解大家最需要什么。比如，在一个村子里，他们就想出了一个“以书换蔬”的好点子，大家可以用捐赠的书换新鲜蔬菜。这个活动大受欢迎！他们**收到**了超过**1万2千本捐赠的书**，这比**十个学校图书馆加起来的书都还要多**！而且，他们已经换出去了**30多吨蔬菜**——这差不多能把一个大游泳池都装满胡萝卜和土豆啦！真是太神奇了！

想象你跟着一群棒棒的学生走在阳光明媚的乡村小路上，看着他们跟农民伯伯阿姨们聊怎么种出更好的庄稼，或者帮忙设计一个好玩的儿童活动空间。他们把年轻的活力和新奇的点子带到了乡村。他们探索的内容可多了，有把当地特色食材做成酷酷的新产品，比如用花椒做的啤酒；也有挖掘和分享当地的文化故事。这说明啊，年轻人用他们的聪明才智去帮助别人时，力量简直是无穷的！

这个比赛鼓励学生们把他们的想法**付诸实践**，亲眼看到自己带来的积极变化。这就是乡村**振兴**（xiāngcūn zhènxīng - 让乡村重新充满活力，变得更好）的意义所在。

如果可以发明东西或开始一个项目帮助你住的地方，你会做什么呀？你会去清理公园，帮助年长的邻居，还是发起一个很酷的垃圾分类活动？

最后，让我们竖起耳朵，听听古老的声音重现！在**河北大学**（Héběi Dàxué - 中国的一所大学），有一群了不起的教授和学生，他们像侦探一样，**花了**将近**30年**时间，把中国古代的音乐重新带回了我们身边。几百年前甚至上千年前，好多好听的歌曲和旋律都被写在特殊的乐谱代码里，但后来没人知道怎么读了。这就像找到了藏宝图，却不知道怎么沿着地图去寻宝！

但是，这个充满毅力的团队一直在努力破解这些古老的密码。他们已经翻译了超过**7千首古代音乐乐谱**（yuèpǔ - 写着歌曲音符的纸）！这些乐谱叠起来，简直能塞满一个房间，从地板堆到天花板！这可是个超级复杂的任务，因为他们不仅要懂音乐，还要懂古代的文字和诗词。他们勇敢地**破解**了**保留**（bǎoliú - 好好地存放在那里）了几百年的密码！真是太酷了！

多亏了他们了不起的工作，这些古老的音乐现在开始被大家听到啦。有些旋律被用在了网络游戏里，让玩游戏的年轻人不经意间就听到了很久很久以前的音乐！还有一些歌曲被重新编排，在舞台上表演，让历史的旋律再次**焕发新机**！

闭上眼睛，想象听到了几百年甚至上千年都没人弹奏过的音乐，就像埋藏了很久的宝藏突然发出美妙的声音！真是太神奇了！学习历史竟然能为现在创造出这么美好的东西。这项研究告诉我们，即使是看似被遗忘的东西，只要我们有好奇心和努力，也能让它重获新生！

也许你可以试试听听我们国家的传统音乐，或者学学弹奏简单的乐器试试看！如果可以学习或让一种古老的艺术或技能重现光彩，你会选什么呢？你会学画古画，练武术，还是学怎么不用现代工具造东西呢？

今天的少年新闻速递就到这里啦！下次见，一起发现更多神奇的事吧！
