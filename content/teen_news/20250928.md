News Discovery Time! Today we want to explore... 
Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever seen polar bears taking over a building? Scientists have discovered something amazing! A group of polar bears has made an abandoned Soviet research station their home. This incredible event happened on Kolyuchin Island in Russia. The polar bears have been seen walking through the hallways, sleeping in offices, and looking out of windows. This shows how climate change has affected animals across different continents.

Imagine standing in the cold Arctic, watching these magnificent white giants wander through a building that humans left behind years ago. The station is as big as 15 basketball courts put together! You can see the bears playing and resting in a place that was once busy with scientists. What would you feel if you saw this amazing sight with your own eyes?

These polar bears have traveled from North America to Asia, crossing the frozen ocean between continents. Scientists believe they have moved because the ice is melting due to global warming. The bears need new places to live as their traditional homes disappear. This is the first time people have seen polar bears taking over a human building on such a large scale. What do you think these bears think about living in a house built by humans?

In exciting technology news, students aged 10-14 have helped design a new robot for space exploration! NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has worked with children from around the world to create "RoboFriend," a special robot that will help astronauts on future missions to the Moon. The robot can carry heavy equipment (weigh up to 50kg), take pictures, and even tell jokes to keep astronauts happy.

Picture yourself floating in space, watching RoboFriend zip around the spacecraft helping with important tasks. The robot is about the same height as your teacher but can move as quickly as a running cat! Students who helped design RoboFriend have visited NASA centers to see how the robot was built. They used special computer programs to draw their ideas, and some of these ideas were included in the final design. If you could design a space robot, what special features would you want it to have?

The students from eight different countries have worked together on this project through video calls and special online meetings. They have learned not only about robots and space but also about working with people from different cultures. Some kids even got to test-use (test/try) early versions of the robot. NASA has said that children often have the most creative ideas because they aren't afraid to think differently.

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索...
砰！噗！哇！

你见过占领大楼的北极熊吗？科学家们发现了一件超酷的事情！一群北极熊把一个废弃的苏联研究站当成了自己的家。这个令人惊叹的事件发生在俄罗斯的科柳钦岛上。这些北极熊被看到在大厅里漫步，在办公室里睡觉，甚至从窗户向外张望。这向我们展示了气候变化是如何影响不同大洲动物的。

想象一下，站在寒冷的北极，看着这些壮观的白色巨兽在人类多年前遗弃的建筑物中游荡。这个研究站相当于15个篮球场那么大！你可以看到熊群在一个曾经忙碌着科学家的地方玩耍和休息。如果你亲眼看到这惊人的景象，你会有什么感觉呢？

这些北极熊从北美洲穿越冻结的海洋来到了亚洲。科学家们认为它们迁徙是因为全球变暖导致冰层融化。随着它们传统家园的消失，熊们需要寻找新的居住地。这是人们第一次看到北极熊如此大规模地占据人类建筑物。你觉得这些熊对住在人类建造的房子里有什么想法呢？

在令人兴奋的科技新闻中，10-14岁的学生们帮助设计了一个用于太空探索的新机器人！NASA（美国太空总署）与来自世界各地的孩子们合作创造了"机器人朋友"，这个特殊机器人将在未来的月球任务中帮助宇航员。这个机器人可以搬运重物（重达50公斤）、拍照，甚至讲笑话来让宇航员开心。

想象自己漂浮在太空中，看着"机器人朋友"在宇宙飞船周围快速移动，帮助完成重要任务。这个机器人和你的老师差不多高，但移动速度却像奔跑的猫一样快！参与设计"机器人朋友"的学生们参观了NASA中心，见识了机器人的建造过程。他们使用特殊的电脑程序绘制自己的想法，其中一些想法被包含在最终设计中。如果你能设计一个太空机器人，你希望它有什么特殊功能呢？

来自八个不同国家的学生们通过视频通话和特殊的在线会议共同完成了这个项目。他们不仅学到了机器人和太空知识，还学会了与来自不同文化的人们合作。一些孩子甚至有机会试用早期版本的机器人。NASA表示，孩子们常常最有创造力，因为他们不怕用不同方式思考。简直不要太厉害！
