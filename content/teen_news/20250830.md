### Tiny Humans Found: The Hobbit Discovery!

Scientists have discovered amazing tiny humans in Indonesia! These "Hobbits" (Homo floresiensis / hoh-moh flor-EN-see-en-sis) have fascinated (interested/amazed) researchers worldwide. Imagine standing in a cave on Flores Island, where archaeologists have carefully uncovered these small bones that are only about 1 meter tall - the same height as a 7-year-old child today!

Researchers have found tools and evidence of fire use near these bones. They have determined that these small humans lived on the island thousands of years ago. Scientists have been studying how they hunted elephants and survived alongside Komodo dragons. The discovery has changed what we know about human evolution.

If you discovered a new human species, what name would you give it and why?
