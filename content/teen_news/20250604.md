## English Version
News Discovery Time! Get ready for some amazing updates! Bang! Pop! Wow!
Today, our journey starts with super smart machines that are changing the world! In **Wuhan** (武汉), China, something really exciting has officially kicked off: the **World Robot Carnival** (世界机器人博览会)! Imagine walking into a place filled with robots of all shapes and sizes, like a futuristic zoo, but for technology! You can **see** robots that look almost like people, able to wave or walk, robots that clean and help with chores or in hospitals, and even big, powerful robots used in factories to build cars or other machines. These amazing machines have come from various fields and companies, showing off the latest tech from many places around the globe. It's a fantastic platform where visitors can really interact with the robots.

The carnival area is truly immense, a fantastic playground for brilliant bots! It covers a space as large as **10 big basketball courts**! Think about all the incredible robots you could fit in that area, each one designed for a special job, from exploring tricky places to helping people daily. Visitors have had a fantastic time already! They have been able to get up close and interact with these robots, asking them questions, watching them perform tasks, and learning what they can do. This helps everyone understand their amazing **capabilities** (能力/abilities) and how they are used in our lives now and in the future. It has been a wonderful showcase of China's progress in robotics, demonstrating cutting-edge **advancements** (进展/progress) and design.

Imagine you are standing right there, surrounded by these incredible machines, watching a robot artist drawing or seeing a service robot bringing something to a person. You **hear** the complex whirs and clicks as they operate smoothly, you **see** the lights blinking and parts moving with precision, and you **feel** incredibly inspired and excited by what humans and robots can achieve together.

If *you* were a robot designer, what amazing new ability would you give your next robot? Would it be super speed, incredible strength, or maybe the ability to understand feelings and tell jokes? What makes your dream robot special and how would it help the world?

Next, let's paddle into a vibrant and thrilling holiday celebration! China recently enjoyed the **Dragon Boat Festival** (端午节) holiday, and it was a super busy time for travel and fun! Over **119 million trips** were made across the country in just three days! To help you imagine that, that number is bigger than the population of many, many countries combined! People were eager to explore and experience different parts of China, seeing new sights and trying new things. This travel boom has seen a lot of activity and **consumption** (消费/spending), with people spending over 42.7 billion yuan ($5.94 billion) – that's a huge amount of money being spent on hotels, food, and fun activities! It has been a truly booming and **prosperous** (繁荣的/successful) time for tourism.

Why so much travel? Many families took trips together because the holiday happened right around International Children's Day. It was a perfect chance for family adventures! Destinations with rich Chinese culture, especially provinces known for exciting dragon boat races like Guangdong and Hunan, were super popular choices. Imagine you are visiting one of these places, maybe standing by a narrow, winding river like in Foshan, Guangdong. You **see** teams of strong paddlers in long, thin, colourful boats, racing down the rivers with amazing speed and skill, performing thrilling turns! You **hear** the loud, rhythmic sound of drums and gongs pushing the teams faster and faster, and the roaring cheers from the crowds lining the banks and even watching from rooftops! You **feel** the intense energy and excitement all around you – it's simply thrilling! Many families also loved trying traditional hands-on activities like carefully wrapping yummy sticky rice dumplings called **zongzi** (粽子) in fresh bamboo leaves, or making beautiful, sweet-smelling little bags called scented sachets to bring good luck. These activities connect people to China's ancient history and traditions.

If *you* could celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival anywhere in China, where would you go, and would you rather experience the intense thrill of a boat race, or learn to make yummy zongzi or fragrant sachets? What part of this **traditional** (传统的/classic) festival calls to you the most and why?

Now, let's take a cultural trip far away across the ocean to **Benin** (贝宁), a country in Africa! In a smaller town called **Akpro-Misserete** (阿克普罗-米塞雷特), which is about **40 kilometers** from Benin's capital city Cotonou – that's like a long bicycle adventure or a short bus ride! – something wonderful has been happening. Ancient Chinese martial arts, like powerful **kung fu** (功夫) and calm, flowing **tai chi** (太极), have found a warm welcome and are being taught to many people. A dedicated teacher named **Damien Agossou Degbo** (达米安·阿戈苏·德格博) has been teaching these skills to many students, both kids and adults, helping them become stronger, healthier, and more disciplined. He is 53 years old and has devoted his time and energy to sharing this amazing part of Chinese culture with his community.

Imagine you are joining one of his outdoor classes under the warm African sun. You **see** students of all ages moving together in powerful, sometimes fast motions for kung fu, and slow, graceful movements for tai chi. You **hear** the rhythmic **thud** (砰击声/beat) of their feet landing on the ground and their sharp, loud shouts like "Hay-Hah!" during the energetic parts of kung fu practice. You also see and hear the quiet focus during the slow, flowing forms of tai chi, which look like a gentle dance. You **feel** your body learning new ways to move, stretching and strengthening, and you feel your mind becoming calmer and more focused. Mr. Degbo believes these martial arts are not just about fighting or exercise; they teach important life philosophies about respect, discipline, and perseverance. He sees them as a fantastic way to build a cultural bridge between his home in Benin and the very old and rich culture of China, showing how traditions can travel and connect people across the world. This cross-cultural sharing is truly special and helps people **gain** (获得/get) new perspectives.

If *you* had the chance to learn one of these ancient arts, which one would you choose and why? Would it be the dynamic power of kung fu or the peaceful balance of tai chi? What positive things do you think you would **achieve** (达到/gain) from learning a martial art regularly?

**Hands-on suggestion!** Martial arts are great for focus and balance. Try this simple exercise safely at home: Stand on one leg for as long as you can without falling, then switch legs. Try to beat your time! Can you feel your body adjusting to stay balanced? This teaches you concentration and control, just like in martial arts! You can also try some gentle stretching!

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要探索... (伴随着三个动感音效！)
砰！啪！哇！

首先，我们来聊聊那些改变世界的超级聪明机器！在中国**武汉**（武hàn），一件超级振奋人心的事情**盛大开幕**（shèngdà kāimù）了：那就是**世界机器人博览会**（Shìjiè Jīqìrén Bólǎnhuì）！想象一下，走进一个到处都是各种各样机器人、仿佛未来科技动物园的地方！你能**看见**长得像人、会挥手会走路的机器人，有负责打扫和帮忙的家务机器人，还有工厂里用来造汽车或其它东西的大块头工业机器人。这些超棒的机器人来自各个领域和公司，它们把全球很多地方的最新技术都展示出来了。这是一个超赞的平台，大家可以在这里近距离接触机器人！

这个博览会场地真是**太大了**！简直就是机器人们的梦幻游乐场，占地面积足足有**10个大篮球场那么大**！想想看，能装下多少酷毙了的机器人啊，每个都有自己的特长，有的能去危险的地方探险，有的能每天帮我们做事情。来参观的人们都已经玩得超级开心了！他们可以走到机器人身边，跟它们互动，问它们问题，看它们表演各种任务，了解它们神奇的**本领**（běnlǐng/abilities），以及它们现在和将来会怎样出现在我们的生活里。这绝对是中国在机器人技术方面取得巨大**进步**（jìnbù/progress）的精彩展示，秀出了顶尖的**能力**（nénglì/capabilities）。

想象你正站在那里，被这些不可思议的机器包围着，看着一个机器人艺术家在画画，或者看到一个服务机器人正把东西递给一个人。你**听见**它们流畅运转时发出各种精密的咔嗒声和嗡嗡声，你**看见**它们的指示灯在闪烁，零件精准地移动，你**感觉**自己被深深地启发，对人类和机器人一起能完成的事情感到超级兴奋。

如果你是一个机器人设计师，你的下一个机器人会拥有什么神奇的新本领？是拥有超快速度，还是力大无穷，或者能理解我们的情绪，甚至会讲笑话？你的梦想机器人特别在哪里，它会怎样帮助世界呢？

接着，我们划着船，去参加一个充满活力和激情的节日庆典！中国最近刚过完了**端午节**（Duānwǔjié）假期，这三天大家玩得可开心了，简直掀起了**出游狂潮**（chūyóu kuángcháo）！短短三天里，全国各地一共有了**1亿1千9百万次出游**！这个数字有多厉害呢？它比好多好多个国家的人口加起来还要多！大家特别想去探索中国不同的地方，看看新风景，试试新玩意。这次旅行大爆发也带来了很多消费**活动**（huódòng/spending），大家一共花了超过427亿人民币（也就是59.4亿美元）——哇塞，这可是一笔巨款啊，都花在住酒店、吃美食和各种好玩的活动上了！这三天对旅游业来说，真是**超！级！火！爆！**

为什么有这么多人出游呢？因为端午节假期正好赶上国际儿童节，很多家庭都抓住机会，一家人一起出去玩，来个家庭大冒险！那些充满浓浓中国文化味儿的地方，尤其是以龙舟赛闻名的地方，比如广东和湖南，成了大家最热门的选择。想象你正在这些地方之一，也许就在广东佛山一条窄窄弯弯的河边。你**看见**一队队强壮的划手坐在一只只又长又窄、五颜六色的船里，在河上**飞速疾驰**（fēisù jí chí），技术超棒，转弯都特别刺激！你**听见**震耳欲聋的鼓声和锣声，催促着队伍越划越快，岸边和甚至屋顶上的观众们发出震耳欲聋的欢呼声！你**感觉**到空气中弥漫着强烈的能量和兴奋——简直太燃了！很多家庭还超喜欢尝试传统的动手活动，比如细心包美味的糯米**粽子**（zòngzi），或者做漂亮又闻起来香香的荷包，希望能带来好运。这些亲手体验的活动，让大家和中国古老的历史文化紧密相连。

如果你能在中国的任何一个地方庆祝端午节，你会想去哪里？你是更想体验刺激的龙舟竞赛，还是想学习包美味的粽子或者香喷喷的荷包？这个**传统**（chuántǒng/classic）节日里，哪个部分最吸引你，为什么呢？

现在，让我们搭乘文化之旅的航班，飞过大洋，去到遥远的非洲国家**贝宁**（Bèiníng）！在**阿克普罗-米塞雷特**（Ākèpǔluó-Mǐsàilèitè）这个小镇上，离贝宁首都科托努大概**40公里**——差不多是你骑自行车骑很远或者坐短途公交的距离！——一件超棒的事情正在发生。古老的中国武术，比如刚劲有力的**功夫**（gōngfu）和柔和流畅的**太极**（tàijí），在那里受到了热烈欢迎，而且有好多人正在学习呢。一位非常**投入**（tóurù/dedicated）的老师，名叫**达米安·阿戈苏·德格博**（Dá mǐān Āgēsū Dé gébó），一直在**传授这些绝技**（chuánshòu zhèxiē juéjì），学生里有小孩也有大人，他帮助他们变得更强壮、更健康、更有纪律性。他今年53岁了，他把自己的时间和精力都用来和他的社区分享中国文化的这个神奇部分。

想象你正加入他的户外武术课，沐浴在温暖的非洲阳光下。你**看见**不同年龄的学生一起行动，练功夫的时候动作有力，有时很快，练太极的时候动作缓慢、优美流畅。你**听见**他们的脚落在地上的有节奏的**砰砰声**（pēng pēng shēng/beat），以及练功夫时响亮、尖锐的喊声，比如“嘿哈！”。你也能看见和听见练太极时那种安静的专注，缓慢流畅的招式看起来就像一种温柔的舞蹈。你**感觉**到自己的身体正在学习新的运动方式，得到舒展和加强，你还感到自己的思绪变得更平静、更专注。德格博老师相信，武术不仅仅是打架或锻炼身体；它教会了人生中重要的**哲学思想**（zhéxué sīxiǎng），比如尊重、纪律和**坚持不懈**（jiānchí bùxiè）。他认为武术是连接他的家乡贝宁和古老又丰富的中国文化的一座超级棒的桥梁，这展示了传统文化如何跨越空间，把世界各地的人们连接在一起。这种**跨文化交流**（kuàwénhuà jiāoliú）真是太特别了，也帮助大家**收获**（shōuhuò/gain）了新的视角。

如果你有机会学习这些古老艺术中的一种，你会选择哪一个？为什么？是选择功夫的活力，还是太极的平和？你认为经常练习武术会让你**获得**（huòdé/achieve）哪些正能量呢？

**动手小建议！** 武术对专注和平衡特别有帮助。在家里安全地试试这个简单的练习吧：单腿站立，尽量站稳站久一点，然后再换另一条腿。看看你能不能刷新自己的记录！你能感觉到身体正在不断调整来保持平衡吗？这就教会了你集中注意力和自我控制，就像练武术一样！你还可以试着做一些简单的拉伸运动哦！
