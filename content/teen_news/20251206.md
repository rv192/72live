News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! a massive dancing dragon and a secret office jungle!

Hello, fantastic friends and fellow news explorers! Welcome back to our weekly news roundup. I'm your host, and I have felt so excited all week to share these stories with you. We have seen some truly amazing things happen, from a festival of light and sound to a quiet room filled with living art. So, let’s jump right in!

Our first stop is in the Jianghua Yao autonomous county (a special administrative area in China for the Yao ethnic group) in Hunan province. Have you ever seen a dragon dance? Well, the people in Jianghua have just hosted a dragon-lion lantern festival that was absolutely spectacular. This grand event was part of the celebrations for the county's 70th anniversary. It was a huge party! Seventy different teams gathered in a park square to show off their amazing skills. Performers came from all over, and their ages were incredible, ranging from just 9 years old all the way to 85 years old. That means kids, parents, and even great-grandparents were all performing together!

Now, let's talk about the stars of the show: the dragons. One team, from a place called Shengang village, presented an unbelievable 200-meter-long dragon. To help you understand how long that is, let's do some math. A standard basketball court is about 28 meters long. This dragon was as long as seven basketball courts placed end to end! Can you imagine trying to make a creature that huge dance and move? It had 77 separate sections, all moving together in beautiful, `intricate/complex` patterns.

Close your eyes for a moment. Imagine you are standing in that crowded square. You can hear the powerful, booming beat of the drums, and you feel the rhythm in your chest. The air is buzzing with excited cheers from thousands of people. Suddenly, you see it. A colossal, glittering dragon snakes its way through the crowd. Its body is a rainbow of brilliant colors, shining under the festival lights. It’s so long you can’t see the end of it. And this wasn't the only amazing sight. Another multicolored dragon was so enormous that it took 1,000 performers to `maneuver/control` it! That’s like the entire student body of a large school working together to make one piece of art come alive.

After the main show, the performers didn't just go home. They took their fantastic dragons and lions on a parade through the main streets of the county. They wanted to spread the happy and festive spirit to everyone. This wonderful tradition is recognized as an important part of their culture, an intangible cultural heritage, which means it’s a special tradition passed down through generations. Today, more than 300 active troupes are keeping this amazing art form alive. It has become a symbol of unity and community. If you could design a section of that giant dragon, what colors and patterns would you use to express your spirit?

From the noisy and colorful festival, our second story takes us to a much quieter, but equally magical, place. We are heading into the office of Sun Yingbao, who is a botanical scientific illustrator at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (China's top science research institution). His job is to draw plants with perfect scientific accuracy. But his office is not just a place for drawing; it has become a living jungle!

Picture this: you push open his office door, but you don't see a desk or computer at first. Instead, you see a living green curtain. A Devil's Ivy plant, which someone had `discarded/thrown away`, has been rescued by Mr. Sun. He has cared for it so well that its vines have grown all the way up to the ceiling. From there, they stretch across the entire room and hang down the other wall, creating a natural screen. The plant has even wrapped its vines around an avocado tree growing nearby.

And that avocado tree has its own special story. Mr. Sun wasn't trying to grow a tree. He just thought the avocado pit looked beautiful, so he placed it on his desk to look at. But one day, to his surprise, the pit cracked open, and a tiny green sprout appeared! Since the little plant showed it wanted to live, he planted it in a pot. Now, it has grown into a small tree that is "one person tall." That’s about as tall as one of us! His small office is filled with these rescued treasures: ferns, spider plants, and even pinecones he found on the ground. He also keeps some small, fragrant fruits called Gouju, which release a wonderful scent when you rub them.

What’s truly special about Sun Yingbao is how he sees the world. He doesn’t just see pretty flowers; he sees scientific mysteries. He has always been curious. He looks at a flower and doesn't just `observe/watch` its beauty. He asks questions. "Why is this flower shaped this way? Why does this one have long petals and another have tiny, tube-like petals?" For him, drawing plants is not just art. It's a way to understand the secrets of nature. He believes that behind every beautiful leaf and petal, there is a scientific reason and a story of survival.

His work is a perfect blend of art and science, a way to create a true and eternal record of nature. He shows us that beauty is everywhere, even in a fallen pinecone or a discarded plant. Sun Yingbao finds stories in things that many people would just walk past. What is something simple around you, maybe in your schoolyard or on your way home, that you could look at more closely to discover its hidden story?

That's all the time we have for today. We have heard stories of community celebration and quiet, personal discovery. Keep your eyes and ears open, because amazing stories are happening all around us, all the time. Until next time, stay curious!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索……砰！啪！哇！一条超巨型的舞动长龙和一个藏在办公室里的秘密丛林！

各位了不起的朋友们，各位新闻小探员，大家好！欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报。我是你们的主持人，这一整个星期我都在激动地期待着和你们分享这些故事。我们看到了些真正了不起的事情，从一个充满光和声音的节日，到一个充满鲜活艺术的安静房间。那么，让我们马上冲进去看看吧！

我们的第一站，是湖南省的江华瑶族自治县（一个为瑶族人民设立的中国特别行政区）。你见过舞龙吗？江华的人们刚刚举办了一场龙狮灯会，简直不要太壮观！这个盛大的活动是庆祝该县成立70周年庆典的一部分。那场面，就是一个超级大派对！足足七十支队伍聚集在公园广场上，展示他们惊人的技艺。表演者们来自四面八方，而且他们的年龄跨度大得惊人，从只有9岁的小朋友，一直到85岁高龄的老爷爷老奶奶。这就意味着，孩子、父母，甚至曾祖父母辈的人们都在一起表演！

现在，咱们聊聊这场秀的“明星”：那些巨龙。其中一支来自一个叫申岗村的队伍，带来了一条长达200米的巨龙，简直让人难以置信。为了让你明白这到底有多长，我们来算一下。一个标准的篮球场大约是28米长。这条龙的长度，相当于七个篮球场首尾相连排成一排！你能想象让这么一个庞然大物跳舞和移动有多难吗？它有77个独立的部分，所有部分都随着鼓点，变幻出优美又复杂的图案。

请闭上眼睛想象一下。你正站在那个拥挤的广场上。你能听到那强劲有力、如同雷鸣的鼓声，你的胸口都能感受到那股节奏。空气里充满了成千上万观众兴奋的欢呼声。突然，你看到了它。一条巨大的、闪闪发光的长龙在人群中蜿蜒穿行。它的身体五颜六色，在节日的灯光下闪耀。它长得让你一眼望不到头。这还不是唯一的奇景。另一条色彩斑斓的巨龙体型更加庞大，需要整整1000名表演者才能操控它！这就好比一所大学校的全体学生一起合作，才让这件艺术品活了起来。

在主场表演结束后，表演者们并没有直接回家。他们带着这些超酷的龙和狮子，在县城的主要街道上巡游。他们想把这份开心和节日的精神传递给每一个人。这项精彩的传统被认为是一种重要的文化，一种非物质文化遗产，意思就是，它是通过一代又一代人传承下来的特殊传统。如今，有超过300个活跃的表演团队在努力让这门了不起的艺术形式继续流传下去。它已经成为了团结和社区精神的象征。如果你可以设计这条巨龙的一部分，你会用什么颜色和图案来表达你的精神呢？

离开喧闹多彩的节日，我们的第二个故事将带我们去一个更安静，但同样神奇的地方。我们要走进孙英宝先生的办公室，他是中国科学院（中国顶尖的科学研究机构）的一位植物科学画师。他的工作就是以完美的科学精准度来画植物。但是，他的办公室不仅仅是个画画的地方，它已经变成了一个生机勃勃的丛林！

你敢信吗？推开他办公室的门，你第一眼看到的可能不是桌子或电脑。相反，你看到的是一堵活的绿色窗帘。一株别人丢弃的绿萝，被孙先生捡(jiǎn)了回来。在他悉心的照料下，它的藤蔓已经长到了天花板。接着，它们沿着天花板爬满了整个房间，又从另一面墙上垂下来，形成了一道天然的屏风。这株植物甚至把藤蔓缠绕在了旁边的一棵牛油果树上。

那棵牛油果树也有它自己的特别故事。孙先生本来没想种树。他只是觉得牛油果的果核形状很好看，就把它放在桌上观赏。但有一天，让他惊喜的是，果核自己裂开了，从裂缝里钻出了一棵绿色的小芽！既然小苗自己想活下来，他便把它种在了花盆里。现在，它已经长成了一棵“一人高”的小树。那差不多就和我们其中一个同学一样高了！他的小办公室里装满了这些“捡”来的宝贝：有蕨类植物、吊兰，还有他从地上捡回来的松果。他还放了几个枸橘(gōu jú)，这是一种很香的果子，用手搓一搓，就会散发出特别好闻的香味。

孙英宝先生最特别的地方，在于他看待世界的方式。他看到的不仅仅是漂亮的花朵，而是科学的谜题。他总是充满好奇。他看着一朵花，不只是欣赏它的美丽。他会问问题。“为什么这朵花长成这个样子？为什么那朵花的花瓣像长长的舌头，而另一朵又像细细的小管子？”对他来说，画植物不只是艺术，更是一种理解自然奥秘的方式。他相信，在每一片美丽的叶子和花瓣背后，都有一个科学上的原因和一个关于生存的故事。

他的工作是艺术和科学的完美结合，是一种为大自然创造真实而永恒记录的方式。他告诉我们，美无处不在，即使是在一颗掉落的松果或一株被丢弃的植物身上。孙英宝在很多人会直接走过的事物中，发现了属于它们的故事。在你的周围，也许是校园里，或是回家的路上，有什么简单的小东西，是你可以更仔细地观察，去发现它隐藏的故事的呢？

今天的时间就到这里了。我们听到了关于社区欢庆和安静的个人发现的故事。请时刻睁大你的眼睛，竖起你的耳朵，因为精彩的故事每时每刻都在我们身边发生。下次再见，保持好奇！
