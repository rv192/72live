News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索... Bang! Pop! Wow!

**Global Warming Creates Rat Army in Cities Worldwide**

Have you noticed more rats scurrying in city streets lately? Scientists have discovered that global warming has caused city rat populations to increase by 30% worldwide! That's like adding 50,000 new rats to each major city - enough rats to fill 20 school buses from top to bottom!

Imagine you're walking through a city park at dusk. You hear the rustling/rustling of leaves, and suddenly you see dozens of rats darting between garbage cans. Scientists have seen this same scene in cities across Asia, Europe, and North America. Warmer temperatures have created perfect conditions for rats to breed and survive.

What would you do if you were chosen to lead a team to control the rat population in your city? Would you use natural predators, special traps, or perhaps a high-tech solution?

**New School Subjects: Robots and AI Enter Classrooms**

Education has transformed completely over the past five years. Schools have created more than 1,000 new technology subjects across the country! That means three new tech programs have started every single day - enough new classes to fill 50 schools!

Imagine sitting in a classroom where your teacher is a friendly robot and you learn coding by playing games with classmates. Students in Beijing and Shanghai have already experienced this amazing learning environment. They have felt the excitement of programming their first robot and have heard the whirring sounds of machines they built themselves.

If you could design a brand-new school subject that doesn't exist yet, what would it be? What cool things would you want to learn in that class?

**The Magic of Cold Tea: A Delicious Science Experiment**

Tea experts have discovered that cold-brewing tea reduces bitter taste by 70% while keeping 85% of the lovely aromas! That means your cold tea could be as smooth as silk while keeping all the wonderful flavors - like turning a sour lemon into sweet lemonade!

Picture yourself on a hot summer afternoon. You reach into the refrigerator and pull out a jar of golden tea you brewed yourself. As you take a sip, you feel the cool liquid spread through your body and taste the gentle flavors dancing on your tongue. People in Asia have enjoyed cold tea for centuries, and now this refreshing drink has become popular in Europe and North America too.

Have you ever tried making your own special drink at home? What interesting ingredients would you add to create your perfect summer drink?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索... 砰！啪！哇！

**全球变暖催生城市老鼠大军**

你最近有没有注意到城市街道上疾驰而过的老鼠越来越多？科学家们发现，全球变暖已经导致全球城市老鼠数量增加了30%！这相当于每个主要城市新增了5万只老鼠——这些老鼠足以装满20辆校车，从车头到车尾挤得满满当当！

想象一下，你正黄昏时分穿过城市公园。你听到树叶沙沙作响，突然看到几十只老鼠在垃圾桶之间疾驰穿梭。科学家们在亚洲、欧洲和北美的城市都目睹了同样的场景。温暖的温度为老鼠繁殖和生存创造了完美条件。

如果你被选为领导一个团队来控制你所在城市的老鼠数量，你会怎么做？你会使用天敌、特殊陷阱，还是高科技解决方案？

**新学科登场：机器人和人工智能进入课堂**

过去五年，教育已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。全国学校已经创建了1000多个新的技术学科！这意味着每天就有三个新的技术项目启动——这些新课程足以填满50所学校！

想象一下，你坐在一个教室里，你的老师是一个友好的机器人，你通过和同学玩游戏来学习编程。北京和上海的学生已经体验过这种令人惊叹的学习环境。他们感受到了编程第一个机器人的兴奋，听到了他们自己建造的机器发出的嗡嗡声。

如果你可以设计一个全新的、目前还不存在的学校科目，它会是什么？你想在那门课上学到什么酷炫的东西？

**冷泡茶的魔力：美味的科学实验**

茶叶专家发现，冷泡茶可以减少70%的苦味，同时保留85%的迷人香气！这意味着你的冷茶可以像丝绸一样顺滑，同时保持所有美妙的风味——就像把酸柠檬变成甜柠檬水一样！

想象一下，在一个炎热的夏日午后。你伸手进冰箱，拿出一罐自己泡制的金色茶水。当你喝一口时，你感觉到清凉的液体流遍全身，品尝到舌尖上舞动的柔和味道。亚洲人享用冷茶已有几个世纪的历史，现在这种清爽的饮料在欧洲和北美也变得流行起来。

你有没有尝试过在家制作自己的特制饮料？你会添加什么有趣的成分来创造你完美的夏日饮品？
