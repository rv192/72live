News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... **Deserts!** (Bang!) **Sunshine!** (Pop!) **Innovation!** (Wow!)

Hello, brilliant broadcasters and welcome to our weekly news roundup! Today, we've seen some truly amazing stories about young people, just like us, who are changing the world with their big brains and even bigger hearts. We have two incredible reports from Shaanxi Province in China, where students have turned their classroom lessons into real-world solutions.

Our first story takes us to the great outdoors, where young innovators are becoming champions for our planet.

Imagine you are standing at the edge of the vast Mu Us Desert (a large desert in northern China). You can feel the wind blowing sand around your feet. It's a tough place for anything to grow. But here, a 25-year-old graduate named Shi Jianyang has continued his family's important work of fighting the desert. Using new techniques he learned at school, he has found a way to help a special type of pine tree, the Pinus sylvestris, not just survive, but thrive! He has raised the survival rate of these young trees to an astonishing 85.2%. That’s like knowing that for every 10 trees you plant, more than 8 will grow up strong and tall. It’s a fantastic achievement! If you could invent something to help nature, what would you create?

From the sandy desert, we travel to the salty fields. Have you ever heard of saline-alkali soil? It's land that has too much salt, making it very difficult for crops to grow. A team of students led by Luo Pengcheng from Xi'an University of Technology has traveled to the Xinjiang region to tackle this very problem. They felt the scorching 40-degree Celsius heat every day as they worked to set up monitoring equipment. After three months of hard work, their brilliant plan has `improved/enhanced` cotton production by 20%! They have helped transform over 5,000 mu of land, which is an area larger than 460 standard football fields. Because of their work, local farmers have seen their incomes grow, which is absolutely wonderful news.

Finally in our first report, let's look up at the sun. For over 20 years, three generations of a team from Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology have focused on a single, shining goal: using solar power for heating in high-altitude areas. They have developed a super `efficient/effective` heat storage technology. Think of it like a giant battery for sunshine! This technology has been used in over 20 counties in Tibet, bringing warmth to more than 500,000 people. And the best part? It reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 36,000 tons every year. That’s like taking more than 7,800 cars off the road completely!

Now, let's zoom from the fields and mountains into the glowing heart of the laboratory, where a different kind of magic is happening. Our second story is about the tech wizards and lab superstars.

Picture this: it's late at night, and in the "Jichuang Studio" at Xidian University, the only light comes from the blinking servers. Here, a group of young students have created their own Artificial Intelligence (AI) training tool called "Swan Lab." Their project has become so popular that it hit number one on GitHub (a famous website for computer programmers). They have even received a 20 million yuan `investment/funding` to grow their idea. Right now, Swan Lab already has 150,000 registered users. That's enough people to fill a giant sports stadium three times!

Next up, let's meet Yang Rui and her team, the "Deuterium V Project," from a vocational college. They have been working on a very complex problem: how to produce a special, high-purity type of Vitamin A. It’s a huge challenge, but they have `achieved/reached` incredible results. Their process has created a product that is 99.7% pure. Can you believe that? That's almost perfectly pure, like a flawless diamond. Their brilliant biotech breakthrough has filled a gap in their country's manufacturing ability.

Our final story for today is truly high-flying. In a lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University, Dr. Ouyang Bo and his team, nicknamed the "Adverse Pressure Walkers," are working on something that helps airplanes fly. They have developed a critical technology for testing the airflow inside advanced aircraft engines. You can almost hear the hum of the powerful machines they work with. Their data is now being used directly in the development of new, cutting-edge airplane engines for their country. It's so inspiring to see students working on projects that have such a massive `impact/effect` on national technology.

From greening deserts to writing complex code, these students in Shaanxi have shown us that age is just a number when it comes to innovation. In total, their educational system has helped launch over 2,500 projects, creating 46,000 jobs. What big problem in the world would you want to solve with your own innovative idea?

That's all the time we have for today. We hope you feel as inspired as we do. Keep dreaming, keep creating, and we'll see you next time on News Discovery Time!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索... **沙漠！**（嘭！）**阳光！**（啪！）**创新！**（哇！）

  各位出色的播报员们，大家好！欢迎收听我们的每周新闻快报！今天，我们看到了一些超级赞的故事，主角是一群和我们差不多的年轻人，他们正用自己的聪明才智和火热的心改变着世界。我们有两条来自中国陕西省的重磅新闻，那里的学生们已经把课堂知识变成了解决现实世界难题的方案。

  我们的第一条新闻，将带我们走进广阔的户外，看看年轻的创新者们如何成为我们地球的守护者。

  想象一下，你正站在广袤(mào)的毛乌素沙漠（中国北方的一个大沙漠）边缘。你能感觉到风把沙子吹到你的脚边。在这里，任何植物想要生长都非常困难。但是，一位名叫石健阳的25岁毕业生，继承了他家人的事业，勇敢地向沙漠宣战。他运用在学校学到的新技术，找到了一个能帮助一种叫做樟(zhāng)子松的特殊松树不仅存活下来，还能茁壮成长的方法！他把这些小树苗的成活率，提升到了惊人的85.2%。这简直就像你每种下10棵树，就有超过8棵能够长成参天大树一样。这可真是个了不起的成就！如果你能发明一样东西来帮助大自然，你会创造什么呢？

  离开黄沙漫漫的沙漠，我们再去看看一片特殊的土地。你听说过盐碱(jiǎn)地吗？那里的土壤里盐分太高，庄稼很难生长。来自西安理工大学的罗鹏程和他带领的团队，就前往新疆地区，专门解决这个难题。他们每天都要感受那40摄氏度火辣辣的高温，辛苦地安装监测设备。经过三个月的奋战，他们那个超赞的方案，竟然让棉花产量提升了20%！他们已经帮助改造了超过5000亩的土地，这面积比460个标准足球场还要大！因为他们的努力，当地棉农的收入也增加了，这简直不要太棒了！

  在我们第一则报道的最后，让我们一起抬头看看太阳。在过去的20多年里，来自西安建筑科技大学的三代人组成的团队，一直专注于一个闪亮的目标：利用太阳能为高原地区供暖。他们研发出一种超级高效的蓄热技术。你可以把它想象成一个给阳光充电的“巨型电池”！这项技术已经在西藏的20多个县区得到应用，为超过50万的居民送去了温暖。最酷的是什么？它每年能减少3.6万吨的二氧化碳排放。这相当于让7800多辆小汽车完全停驶一整年！

  现在，让我们从田野和高山，瞬间移动到闪烁着科技之光的实验室里，那里正发生着另一种“魔法”。我们的第二条新闻，是关于技术奇才和实验室里的超级明星。

  想象这个场景：夜深了，在西安电子科技大学的“极创工作室”里，唯一的光亮来自服务器上闪烁的指示灯。在这里，一群年轻学生创造了他们自己的人工智能训练工具，取名为“Swan Lab”。他们的项目太受欢迎了，很快就登上了GitHub（一个著名的程序员网站）的热榜第一名。他们甚至还获得了2000万元的投资，来发展这个创意。目前，“Swan Lab”已经拥有15万注册用户。你敢信吗？这人数足以坐满一个巨型体育场三次！

  接下来，我们来认识一下杨蕊和她的“氘(dāo)维计划”团队，他们来自一所职业技术大学。他们一直在攻克一个非常复杂的问题：如何生产一种特殊的、高纯度的维生素A。这是一个巨大的挑战，但他们取得了令人难以置信的成果。他们研发的工艺，制造出的产品纯度高达99.7%。简直了！这几乎是完美纯净，就像一颗没有任何瑕疵的钻石。他们这个绝妙的生物技术突破，填补了他们国家在高端原料生产领域的一项空白。

  我们今天的最后一条新闻，绝对是“高高在上”的。在西北工业大学的实验室里，欧阳波博士和他的团队，外号“逆压行者”，正在研究帮助飞机飞行的项目。他们为测试先进航空发动机内部的气流，研发了一项关键技术。你几乎能听到他们使用的那些强大机器发出的嗡嗡声。他们的试验数据现在被直接用于国家新型尖端飞机发动机的研制。看到学生们能参与到对国家科技有如此重大影响的项目中，真是太鼓舞人心了。

  从绿化沙漠到编写复杂代码，陕西的这些学生向我们证明了，在创新面前，年龄只是一个数字。总的来说，他们的创新创业教育体系已经推动了超过2500个项目落地，创造了4.6万个就业岗位。如果是你，你想用自己的创新点子来解决世界上的哪个大问题呢？

  今天的时间就到这里了。希望你和我们一样备受鼓舞。保持梦想，不断创造，我们下期“新闻探索时间”再见！
