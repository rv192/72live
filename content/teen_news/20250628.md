News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow! ...busy bugs, brilliant robots, and bright brushes! Get ready for some awesome news from around the world!

First up, let's talk about tiny creatures that can cause big problems: locusts! Scientists in China have been very busy bees, studying these hopping insects. You know how sometimes you see a few grasshoppers? Well, locusts can get together in *huge* swarms. Imagine a cloud of insects so enormous, it could cover an area as big as over 20,000 basketball courts! That's gigantic! These swarms can travel across different countries and even continents, eating almost every green plant in their path. We've seen these swarms cause problems in parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, threatening food for millions of people. It's a serious issue for farmers globally.

But good news! Chinese researchers from the Institute of Zoology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Peking University have made a super important discovery. They have found the secret signal that makes lonely locusts gather into these scary swarms. This signal is a special chemical smell called a pheromone (一种昆虫用来交流的化学信号). It's like a "come here!" message only other locusts can smell. The scientists have figured out exactly how locusts make this special smell!

Now, here's where it gets really cool. By understanding how the locusts make this pheromone using certain enzymes, the scientists have found a way to trick them! They found that a natural chemical called 4-nitrophenol (4NP), often found in plants, can block the enzymes the locusts need to make their gathering smell. Think of it like putting a 'wrong key' in a lock – the locusts can't make the chemical signal anymore! This new discovery could help scientists create "fake messages" or inhibitors (抑制剂/blockers) that stop the locusts from forming huge swarms. Instead of spraying large areas with pesticides, which can contaminate (污染/spoil) the environment, scientists might be able to use these targeted methods. For example, if locusts don't gather, they don't produce a warning chemical that protects them from birds. So, birds might eat them instead! This could lead to more eco-friendly ways to control these pests.

Imagine standing in a quiet field in the countryside. You feel the gentle wind on your face and see green plants growing tall. Suddenly, you hear a low hum in the distance. It gets louder and louder, buzzing and clicking! You look up and see the sky starting to darken as a massive wave of locusts flies towards you! It's an overwhelming feeling, knowing they can eat everything you've worked so hard to grow. But now, maybe, with science, we can stop these big swarms before they even start.

If you were a scientist, what kind of 'fake message' would you create to trick the locusts and keep them from swarming?

Next up, let's blast off into the world of technology and bright young minds! In Zhangye (张掖), a city in Gansu (甘肃) province, China, students at Siyuan Experimental School recently had a fantastic time at their Campus Science Festival. The theme was "Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI), Lighting Up Tech Dreams." It sounds super exciting!

Over 500 students got to explore and play with technology firsthand! They didn't just read about robots or computers; they actually got to control them! The festival was filled with cool activities like writing simple code (编程) to make robots move, fixing small problems with robots (调试机器人), learning to fly drones (操控无人机), and even using laser cutters (激光切割) to create things. It was a real hands-on experience. Imagine walking into a bustling gym or hall filled with whirring sounds and blinking lights. You see kids gathered around tables, eyes glued to screens or little machines. Some are carefully guiding small drones through obstacle courses in the air. Others are helping robots follow lines on the floor. You feel the excitement in the air as students successfully complete a task or get their creation to work. It's a place where learning feels like playing.

This kind of event is so important because it lets students get a taste of future technologies and helps ignite (点燃/spark) their curiosity about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). By letting them experiment and build, it shows them that technology isn't just complicated stuff adults do; it's something they can understand and create with right now! They get to see the direct result of their efforts, like a robot actually following their commands.

If you could invent a robot to help you with something at school or home, what would it do and what would it look like?

Finally, let's look at how art can be a wonderful way to celebrate and learn! In Jiangsu (江苏) province, China, young artists at Li Ji Town Center Primary School in Suining (睢宁) County had a creative project. They were getting ready to celebrate a special anniversary and decided to use painting to show their feelings and learn about history. The theme was "Learning Party History, Cultivating Children's Hearts," and they were welcoming the 104th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Over 100 children worked together on a giant themed painting! Imagine a piece of white cloth spread out that's as long as a school bus! That's a *huge* canvas! All the children gathered around, holding paintbrushes and dipping them into colorful paints. They worked side-by-side, adding their ideas and strokes to the big picture. Think about the feeling of collaborating (合作/working together) with so many friends on one big artwork. You smell the fresh paint, see the bright colors appearing on the white cloth, and feel the shared excitement as the painting grows. Every child added something unique, and together, they created something beautiful and meaningful. It's a fantastic way to learn about important events and express yourselves.

This project shows how art can bring people together and be used for learning and celebration. It's not just about painting pretty pictures; it's about expressing ideas, working as a team, and connecting with history or important moments. It sounds like they had so much fun making this giant piece of art together!

This sounds like so much fun! Maybe you could try a similar project with your classmates – grab some big paper or even old cardboard boxes and create a giant mural together! What big picture would *you* paint with all your friends?

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! Keep exploring the amazing world around you!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索... 砰！啪！哇！...忙碌的小虫子、酷炫的机器人，还有闪闪发光的画笔！准备好接收来自世界各地的精彩新闻了吗？

第一个大新闻！咱们来聊聊那些小小的、却能造成大麻烦的小家伙：蝗虫！中国的科学家叔叔阿姨们一直在非常努力地研究这些蹦蹦跳跳的虫子。你知道吗，有时候你看不到几只蚱蜢，但蝗虫却会聚集起来，变成*巨大*的蝗虫群！想象一下，一群虫子多得像一朵巨大的云，面积能铺满超过2万个篮球场！那简直是密密麻麻，太惊人了！这些蝗虫群能飞过不同的国家，甚至跨越大陆，把它们经过的绿色植物几乎都吃光光。我们看到，在非洲、亚洲和澳大利亚的一些地方，这些蝗虫群惹过大麻烦，威胁着数百万人的粮食安全。这对全世界的农民来说，真是个大挑战！

但是，好消息来啦！中国的科学家，来自中国科学院动物研究所和北京大学的研究团队，有了一个超级重要的发现！他们找到了让那些孤单的蝗虫聚集起来形成可怕大军的秘密信号。这个信号是一种特殊的化学“香味”，叫做信息素（Pheromone，一种小虫子用来互相聊天的化学信号）。这就像是一个只有蝗虫自己能闻到的“快到我这里来！”的邀请信息。科学家们已经完全搞清楚了蝗虫是怎样制造出这种特殊香味的！

接下来就更酷了。科学家们明白了蝗虫是怎样利用一些特殊的“小工具”（酶）来制造这种香味的，他们就找到了一个“骗”蝗虫的好办法！他们发现了一种叫做4-硝基苯酚（4NP）的天然化学物质，它经常在植物里出现。这种物质能把蝗虫制造香味需要用到的“小工具”给“锁住”！就像你拿了一把“错”的钥匙去开锁一样，蝗虫就不能再制造那个聚集信号了！这个新发现也许能帮助科学家制造出“假消息”或者“堵塞剂”（inhibitors，抑制剂/blockers），阻止蝗虫形成巨大的群体。这样一来，就不需要大范围地喷洒农药了，因为农药可能会污染（contaminate/spoil）环境。比如，如果蝗虫不聚在一起，它们就不会制造出保护自己不被鸟吃掉的警告化学物质。这样，小鸟就可能去吃它们啦！这能帮助我们用更环保（ecological friendly）的方式来控制这些害虫。

想象你站在宁静的乡间田野里，微风轻轻吹过脸颊，看到绿色的庄稼长得高高的。突然，你听到远处传来低低的嗡嗡声，越来越响，带着咔哒咔哒的声音！你抬头一看，天空开始变暗，一大片蝗虫像海浪一样朝你飞过来！那种感觉太让人担心了，你知道它们能把你辛苦种的一切都吃光。但是现在，也许通过科学，我们能在这些巨大的蝗虫群形成之前，就阻止它们！

如果换成你，你会用什么样的“假消息”来忽悠这些小蝗虫，让它们不聚群呢？

接下来，咱们要发射到科技世界，看看聪明的小朋友们！在中国的甘肃省张掖市，思源实验学校的同学们最近过了一个超棒的校园科技节！科技节的主题是“探索人工智能，点燃科技梦想”。听起来就超级燃！

超过500名同学有机会亲手探索和玩转科技！他们不是只在书本上学习机器人或者电脑知识，而是真的能控制它们！科技节里充满了各种酷炫的项目，比如编写简单的程序（coding）让机器人动起来，给机器人解决小问题（debugging robots），学习怎么遥控无人机（controlling drones），甚至还体验了用激光切割（laser cutting）来制作东西。这完全是动手实践！想象你走进一个充满活力的大体育馆或者大厅，里面有嗡嗡的马达声和闪烁的灯光。你看到同学们围着桌子，眼睛紧盯着屏幕或者小机器。有的同学正小心翼翼地引导小无人机飞过空中的障碍物。有的则在帮助机器人沿着地上的线前进。你感受到空气中弥漫着兴奋，因为同学们成功完成了任务，或者让他们的创意变成了现实。这是一个让学习变得像玩一样有趣的地方！

这样的活动太重要了，它能让同学们提前感受未来的科技，帮助点燃（ignite/spark）他们对科学、技术、工程和数学（STEM）的好奇心。通过让他们自己去尝试、去搭建，这告诉他们科技并不是大人才懂的复杂东西；而是他们现在就能理解和创造的东西！他们能亲眼看到自己努力的成果，比如机器人真的按照他们的指令动了。

要是让你发明一个能帮你完成某件事情的机器人，不管是学校的作业还是家里的事情，它会是什么样子的，又有什么超能力呢？

最后，咱们来看看艺术是怎样一种美妙的方式来庆祝和学习的！在中国的江苏省睢宁县李集镇中心小学，小朋友们最近完成了一个非常有创意的绘画项目。他们正在准备庆祝一个特别的日子，所以决定用画画来表达自己的心情，也学习一段历史。活动的主题是“学党史 育童心”，他们是在用画笔迎接中国共产党成立104周年。

超过100位小朋友一起完成了一幅巨大的主题画！想象一下，一块白色的画布铺开，有校车那么长！那真是一块*超级大*的画板！所有的小朋友都围了过来，手里拿着画笔，蘸着五颜六色的颜料。他们肩并着肩一起努力，把自己的想法和笔触加到这幅大画里。想想看，和这么多好朋友一起合作（collaborate/work together）完成一幅大大的艺术品，那种感觉真是太好了！你闻到新鲜颜料的味道，看到五彩缤纷的颜色在你和朋友的笔下像变魔术一样出现在白色的大布上，感受到大家一起完成任务的共同喜悦。每个小朋友都画了自己独特的部分，然后合在一起，就完成了一幅既漂亮又有意义的作品。这是一种学习重要事件和表达自己的绝佳方式。一起画画，*简直不要太开心*！

这个项目告诉我们，艺术不仅能把大家聚在一起，还能用来学习和庆祝。它不仅仅是画好看的画，更是表达想法、团队合作、以及连接历史或重要时刻的方式。听起来他们一起完成这幅大画的过程，一定充满了乐趣！

这个活动听起来太有趣了！说不定你也可以和班里的同学一起试试看，找些大纸或者旧纸箱子，一起画一个大大的壁画！如果你有机会和所有好朋友一起画一幅超大超大的画，你们会画什么内容呢？

好了，今天的《新闻探索时间》就到这里啦！记得保持好奇心，继续探索我们身边这个精彩的世界哦！
