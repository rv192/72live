News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring amazing animal adventures, cool classroom tech, and dazzling ancient art!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

Get ready for some truly exciting news, especially for all you animal lovers! Two incredibly adorable and famous giant pandas, Xing Xing (星星) and Liang Liang (亮亮), have finally returned home to China after spending 11 years living in Malaysia! Can you believe it? Eleven whole years is a super long time, like waiting for your birthday party eleven times, plus waiting another whole year! These fluffy friends have been living happily in Malaysia (马来西亚), far across the sea from their homeland in Asia. But now, they have completed their big journey and have arrived safely at the Giant Panda Conservation and Research Center (中国大熊猫保护研究中心) in Ya'an (雅安), Sichuan (四川), China (中国)! To make sure they are perfectly healthy and comfortable after their travels, they have started a special 30-day quarantine (隔离/isolation) period. It's like a cozy hotel stay just for pandas! These pandas are extra famous because they were sent to Malaysia back in 2014 as a special symbol of friendship between China and Malaysia, celebrating 40 years of connection! They have certainly been busy pandas abroad, meeting lots of new people and munching on bamboo! Imagine feeling the cool bamboo shoots in a different place, hearing the sounds of new forests, and now finally feeling the soil of your home country under your paws and seeing friendly, familiar faces after so, so long! It must be an emotional journey for them! What do you think their panda dreams have been like while they were away, perhaps dreaming of Sichuan bamboo? And what exciting adventures are waiting for them next in their beautiful new/old home? Pandas are precious national treasures, and everyone is so happy they have completed their journey safely and are back where they belong!

Now, let's power up our brains with some super cool future tech news that feels almost like science fiction! Have you ever wished learning felt more like a personalized adventure designed just for *you*? Well, get ready, because at some universities, like the famous Wuhan University (武汉大学), Artificial Intelligence (AI) (人工智能/Artificial Intelligence) is stepping into the classroom as a fantastic new helper! Students have been eagerly trying out special AI assistants (助教/teaching assistant) that live inside a smart online learning system called the Luojia Online AI Smart Teaching Center (珞珈在线AI智慧教学中心). Imagine your own personal AI character popping up on screen, ready to chat, explain tricky things, and guide you! This clever system shows students different kinds of 'maps' to help them learn – like Knowledge Maps showing what you already know, Problem Maps showing questions you need to solve, Capability Maps for building cool skills, and Goal Maps for what you're aiming to achieve! That’s four different magic maps helping you explore your learning journey! When students answer questions, the AI scores them right away, gives smart hints, and even explains *why* an answer is right or wrong. Teachers have started to use this real-time data to understand exactly what each student needs help with, almost like giving everyone a special, tailor-made learning plan just for them. And here's the really exciting part – students can even use VR (虚拟现实/Virtual Reality) headsets for practical lessons! Imagine putting on a headset and stepping into a virtual world to practice fixing electrical things or performing experiments safely! It feels just like playing a super cool, helpful game, but you're learning real skills! This technology is really facilitating (/helping) learning in exciting and dynamic new ways, making education smarter and more personal for everyone involved. If an AI could help you learn anything you want perfectly, taking you on virtual adventures, what amazing subject or skill would you choose to learn first? It sounds like a really smart and fun way to make education more effective and engaging!

Finally, let's travel to the mountains and talk about ancient treasures and how creative kids are keeping history alive! High up in the rocky mountains of Gansu (甘肃), China, there's a truly magical place called the Maijishan Grottoes (麦积山石窟). It's not just a mountain; it's a giant work of art! People carved incredible statues and beautiful paintings right into the side of the stone long, long ago. This art is truly ancient (古老的), around 1,700 years old! Can you even imagine something lasting that long? That’s like going back in time for over 17 lifetimes, or even older than putting together the ages of maybe 30 of your great-grandparents! It's a connection to a super distant past. Students at Tianshui Normal University (天水师范学院) have been visiting these amazing grottoes and feeling incredibly inspired by the history and beauty they see. Their dedicated teachers, like Mr. Wang Yichao, have spent years studying this ancient art, carefully unlocking its secrets and sharing its stories with the students. Imagine hiking up a winding mountain trail, turning a corner, and suddenly seeing hundreds of incredible, ancient statues and colorful paintings carved right into the rock face, some with famous, gentle smiles, like the 'Oriental Smile'! It makes you feel small but also connected to history. The students have seen famous cave numbers like 133 and 44, filled with artistic wonders. This inspiration has led them to create their *own* fantastic artwork! They have been making beautiful new pictures and designs based on what they've seen, sometimes cleverly mixing the old ideas, like figures that look like they're flying, with new ones, like modern astronauts exploring space! They have been sharing their cool creations online, too, for everyone to see. This wonderful connection between old art and new creativity helps to preserve (/protect) this amazing culture by showing how it can still inspire and be relevant to young people today. What kind of ancient art, history, or maybe even old family stories makes *you* feel connected to the past? Perhaps you could try drawing your own pictures or writing your own stories inspired by something old that you find fascinating! Art and creativity are fantastic ways to connect the past, the present, and the future!
