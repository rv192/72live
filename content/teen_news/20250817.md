## English Version
**(Intro Music with an energetic beat)**

**Host:** News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... **(Sound effects: Bang! Pop! Wow!)** ...glowing forests, super-smart robots, and art made from trash!

**(Upbeat transitional sound)**

**Host:** Our first story takes us deep into the mysterious rainforests of two different continents. Scientists have been buzzing with excitement because they have discovered a new species of glowing mushroom! This isn't just any mushroom; it’s a biological wonder. They have found these fantastic fungi in both the Amazon rainforest in South America and the Borneo rainforest in Asia, almost *simultaneously* (at the same time/together). This is incredibly rare. Usually, a new species is found in just one location.

Imagine this: you are walking through the dark jungle at night. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and flowers. You hear the strange calls of night animals. Suddenly, you see a soft, green light on the forest floor. It pulses gently, like a tiny forest heartbeat. You have just seen *Luminospora Nocturna*, the new name given to this mushroom. Its glow comes from a natural chemical process called Bioluminescence (pronounced bye-oh-loo-min-ESS-ents), which is the same magic that makes fireflies light up.

Scientists have reported that the total area where these mushrooms have been found is enormous. If you put all the glowing patches together, they would cover an area larger than 5,000 standard football fields! They feel this discovery is very important. The glow is bright enough that if you gathered a basketball-sized clump of them, you could actually read a book in the dark. How cool is that? Researchers are now studying if the mushroom’s glow helps it attract insects to spread its spores. It’s like a secret communication system in nature. This beautiful, glowing green garden shows us that our planet still has so many secrets we haven't uncovered. What do you think? If you had the chance to name this glowing fungus, what amazing name would you give it?

**(Upbeat transitional sound)**

**Host:** Next up, we’re blasting off from the forest floor into the world of technology! We have seen how clever nature can be, and now we see how clever kids can be, too. Last month, the "Global Robo-Recycler Challenge" was held, and young inventors from all over the world have created some truly *spectacular* (amazing/wonderful) machines. The challenge was simple: build a robot that can help save our planet by sorting recycling.

A team of four middle school students from Canada, calling themselves "The Eco-Engineers," has won the grand prize. Their robot, named "Trash Titan," is a masterpiece of engineering. Using a camera and a special computer program, it can identify and sort plastic, paper, and metal with amazing speed. They built it in their school's garage using parts from old computers and simple controllers like Arduino (pronounced ar-DWEEN-oh), which is a mini-computer board many people use for fun projects.

Let’s visualize its power. The Trash Titan can sort over 500 kilograms of mixed recycling every single day! That is about the same weight as five adult giant pandas. It works so *efficiently* (quickly and well/effectively) that it makes fewer mistakes than a human worker. Now, picture this: you're in a huge, noisy arena. Teams of kids are huddled around their amazing robot creations. Lights are flashing, and buzzers are sounding. You feel your heart beating fast as you place your robot in the competition zone and press the 'Go' button. That's the excitement these kids have felt! Their success has inspired so many others. The team has even made their building plans free online, so anyone can try to build their own recycling robot. If you could build a robot to solve one problem in our school, what problem would it solve?

**(Upbeat transitional sound)**

**Host:** For our final piece of news, let's mix art with saving the planet. In Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, a massive community art project has just started, and it’s turning trash into treasure. The project, called "Pixels of our Planet," invites everyone—kids, parents, and grandparents—to *collaborate* (work together/team up) on creating a gigantic mosaic. And what are they using for their art supplies? Millions of colourful plastic bottle caps!

Imagine you are standing in a sunny city square. All around you, people are laughing and talking, gluing bright bottle caps onto huge wooden boards. You see a sea of red, blue, green, and yellow. You pick up a shiny blue cap and find the perfect spot for it in a giant picture of a whale. You can feel the teamwork and excitement as the picture slowly comes to life. It’s a powerful feeling to know you are part of creating something so big and beautiful.

The final mosaic will be absolutely huge. When finished, its total size will be as large as three professional basketball courts put together! It's expected to use more than two million bottle caps, all collected from local beaches and recycling centers. This project not only creates a stunning piece of public art but also sends a strong message about recycling and protecting our oceans. It has already inspired similar, smaller projects in schools nearby.

This is something you can try at home! You don't need a giant square. You can start small. Collect some bottle caps, old buttons, or cut up pieces from old magazines. With some glue and a piece of cardboard, you can create your own mini-mosaic. What picture or pattern would you create if you made a mosaic from things you found at home?

**(Outro Music starts to fade in)**

**Host:** And that’s all for today’s News Discovery Time! We have seen glowing mushrooms, we have heard about brilliant kid inventors, and we have felt the fun of making art together. Keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep being awesome! See you next time!

  **(开场是节奏感超强的音乐)**

**主持人：** News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索... **(音效: 砰! 啪! 哇!)** ...闪闪发光的森林、超级聪明的机器人，还有用垃圾变出来的艺术品！

**(欢快的过渡音效)**

**主持人：** 我们的第一条新闻，要带我们深入到两个不同大洲的神秘雨林里去。科学家们最近简直不要太激动，因为他们发现了一种会发光的新蘑菇！这可不是普通的蘑菇，这是一个大自然的奇迹。他们在南美洲的亚马逊雨林和亚洲的婆罗洲雨林里，几乎是*同时*（at the same time/together）发现了这些神奇的菌类。这种情况可是非常少见的哦，通常一个新物种只会在一个地方被找到。

想象一下这个场景：太阳下山后，你正走在漆黑的丛林里。空气里充满了湿润泥土和花朵的香味，还能听到各种夜间动物奇怪的叫声。突然，你看到地上有一片柔和的绿光，像一颗小小的森林心脏一样，轻轻地跳动着。你刚刚看到的就是“夜光孢子菌”（*Luminospora Nocturna*），这是给这种新蘑菇起的名字。它的光芒来自一种叫作“生物发光”（Bioluminescence，读作 bye-oh-loo-min-ESS-ents）的自然化学反应，萤火虫就是用同样的魔法来点亮自己尾巴的。

科学家们报告说，发现这些蘑菇的总面积大得惊人。要是把所有发光的区域拼在一起，它们的面积比5000个标准足球场还要大！他们觉得这个发现意义重大。这些蘑菇的亮度也很给力，只要你把篮球那么大的一团蘑菇聚在一起，居然能在黑暗中看书。这是不是超酷的？研究人员正在研究，这种光是不是为了吸引昆虫来帮它传播孢子。这就像大自然里的一套秘密通讯系统。这片美丽的绿色发光花园告诉我们，我们的地球还有好多好多的秘密等着我们去揭开呢。如果是你，你会给这个会发光的蘑菇起个什么了不起的名字呢？

**(欢快的过渡音效)**

**主持人：** 接下来，我们要从森林地面，“发射”到科技的世界！我们刚看到了大自然有多聪明，现在来看看我们的小朋友们有多厉害。上个月，“全球机器人回收挑战赛”举行了，来自全世界的小小发明家们创造了一些真正*壮观的*（amazing/wonderful）机器。比赛的要求很简单：造一个能通过分拣可回收物来帮助拯救地球的机器人。

一个由四名中学生组成的加拿大队伍，他们自称“生态工程师”，赢得了特等奖。他们的机器人名叫“垃圾泰坦”，简直是工程学的杰作。它用一个摄像头和一个特殊的电脑程序，就能飞快地识别并且分开塑料、纸张和金属。他们是在学校的车库里，用旧电脑的零件和像Arduino（阿尔杜伊诺，读作 ar-DWEEN-oh）这样简单的控制器把它造出来的。Arduino是一种很多人都喜欢用来做小发明的迷你电脑主板。

让我们来感受一下它的威力。“垃圾泰坦”每天能分拣超过500公斤的混合回收物！这差不多和五只成年大熊猫的体重一样重了。它的工作*效率*（quickly and well/effectively）特别高，犯的错误比人类工人还要少。现在，你来想象一下：你正站在一个巨大又吵闹的体育馆里。一群群的孩子们正围着他们超棒的机器人作品。灯光闪烁，蜂鸣器响个不停。当轮到你的机器人上场时，你感觉心跳加速，然后按下了“开始”按钮。这些孩子们感受到的就是这种激动人心的时刻！他们的成功鼓舞了很多人。这支队伍甚至把机器人的制作图纸免费放到了网上，这样所有人都能试着造一个自己的回收机器人啦。如果你能造一个机器人来解决咱们学校里的一个问题，你会让它解决什么问题呢？

**(欢快的过渡音效)**

**主持人：** 最后一条新闻，我们来把艺术和保护地球结合在一起。在葡萄牙的首都里斯本，一个超大型的社区艺术项目刚刚启动，它正在把垃圾变成宝贝。这个项目名叫“我们星球的像素画”，邀请所有人——小孩、爸爸妈妈、爷爷奶奶——一起来*协作*（work together/team up），创作一幅巨大的马赛克画。你猜他们用的美术材料是什么？是几百万个五颜六色的塑料瓶盖！

想象一下，你正站在一个阳光明媚的城市广场上。你周围的人们一边说笑，一边把亮晶晶的瓶盖粘到巨大的木板上。你眼前是红色、蓝色、绿色和黄色的海洋。你捡起一个闪亮的蓝色瓶盖，在一幅巨大的鲸鱼图案里为它找到了最完美的位置。你能感觉到那种团队合作和兴奋的感觉，这幅画正在一点点变得鲜活起来。知道自己正在参与创造这么巨大又美丽的东西，那感觉真是棒极了。

这幅马赛克画最终会变得无比巨大。当它完成的时候，总面积会像三个专业的篮球场拼起来那么大！预计会用掉超过两百万个瓶盖，这些瓶盖全都是从当地的海滩和回收中心收集来的。这个项目不仅创造了一件引人注目的公共艺术品，也传递了一个关于回收利用和保护海洋的强烈信息。它已经启发了附近学校里很多类似的小型项目。

这个活动你在家也能试试看！你不需要一个大广场。你可以从小处着手。收集一些瓶盖、旧纽扣，或者从旧杂志上剪下一些小色块。用一些胶水和一块硬纸板，你就能创作出自己的迷你马赛克画。如果用在家里找到的东西来做一幅马赛克画，你会创作出什么样的图画或图案呢？

**(结尾音乐缓缓响起)**

**主持人：** 好了，今天的“News Discovery Time”就到这里！我们看到了会发光的蘑菇，听说了天才小发明家的故事，还感受了一起动手做艺术的乐趣。大家要继续探索，继续提问，继续做最棒的自己哦！我们下次再见！
