News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! 

Have you ever wondered how animals behave differently in various parts of the world? Scientists have recently discovered an amazing phenomenon involving penguins and leopard seals that has happened across three continents! In Antarctica, South America, and even Africa, researchers have observed that leopard seals not only hunt penguins but sometimes "gift" them to humans. These playful predators have been seen catching penguins and then approaching research boats as if bringing presents. The discovery, which spans oceans covering an area equivalent to 5,000 football fields, has amazed scientists worldwide. Imagine you're standing on a cold Antarctic shore when suddenly a leopard seal surfaces with a penguin in its mouth, then swims right up to you! What do you think the seal might be trying to communicate? If you could ask these clever creatures one question, what would it be?

Technology is making incredible leaps, and kids are leading the way! A group of 10 to 14-year-old students from five different countries has participated in a revolutionary space project. These young tech enthusiasts have helped NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) develop a new robot that will explore (investigate/check) Mars. The robot, named "Space Kids Explorer," has been designed with suggestions from over 1,000 children worldwide. Imagine you're sitting in a mission control room, watching on a big screen as the robot you helped design moves across the red surface of Mars! The students have contributed ideas for the robot's arms, cameras, and even its communication system. The children's suggestions have made the robot 30% more efficient than previous models. How would you design a Mars robot if you had the chance? What special features would your robot have to explore the mysterious Red Planet?

Art and culture are connecting people across the globe in new ways this month. The "Children's Art Exchange" program has launched an amazing exhibition where kids from different countries create and share their artwork. The exhibition has already attracted (drawn/brought in) over 10,000 visitors in its first week alone, with artwork displayed across galleries equivalent to about three basketball courts in size. Imagine walking into a colorful room where paintings from Japan hang next to sculptures from Brazil, and photographs from Kenya are displayed beside digital art from Canada! The program encourages children to express themselves through various mediums like painting, clay modeling, and digital design. If you could create a piece of art to represent your culture to the world, what would it be? How would you use colors and shapes to tell your story?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索...砰！啪！哇！

有没有想过世界各地的动物会有怎样不同的行为？科学家最近发现了一个涉及企鹅和豹海豹的惊人现象，这个现象横跨三大洲！在南极洲、南美洲甚至非洲，研究人员观察到豹海狮不仅捕食企鹅，有时还会把它们"赠送"给人类。这些爱玩耍的捕食者被看到捕捉企鹅后，好像带着礼物一样靠近研究船。这个发现跨越了相当于5000个足球场大小的海洋区域，让全世界的科学家都感到惊叹。想象你站在寒冷的南极洲海岸，突然一只豹海狮嘴里叼着企鹅浮出水面，然后直接向你游来！你觉得这只海狮可能想要传达什么信息？如果可以问这些聪明的生物一个问题，你会问什么呢？

科技正在取得惊人进步，而孩子们正引领着潮流！来自五个不同国家的一群10至14岁的学生参与了一项革命性的太空项目。这些年轻的科技爱好者帮助NASA（美国太空总署）开发了一种将探索火星的新型机器人。这个名为"太空儿童探险者"的机器人是根据全球1000多名儿童的建议设计的。想象你坐在任务控制室里，看着大屏幕上你帮助设计的机器人在火星红色表面上移动！学生们为机器人的手臂、摄像机甚至通信系统提供了建议。孩子们的建议使这个机器人比以前的型号效率提高了30%。如果你有机会，你会如何设计一个火星机器人？你的机器人会有什么特殊功能来探索神秘的红色星球？

艺术和文化在这个月以新的方式连接着全球各地的人们。"儿童艺术交流"项目启动了一个令人惊叹的展览，来自不同国家的孩子们创作并分享他们的艺术作品。仅第一周，这个展览就吸引了超过10000名参观者，展出的艺术品占据了相当于约三个篮球场大小的画廊空间。想象你走进一个色彩缤纷的房间，日本的画作旁边挂着巴西的雕塑，肯尼亚的照片展现在加拿大的数字艺术旁边！该项目鼓励孩子们通过绘画、陶艺和数字设计等各种媒介表达自己。如果你可以创作一件代表你的文化向世界展示的艺术品，它会是什么？你会如何运用颜色和形状来讲述你的故事？
