News Discovery Time! Today we want to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever heard of penguins escaping from a scary leopard seal? Scientists have been watching a funny relationship between these animals in Antarctica and Africa. They have seen that sometimes, a clever penguin can trick a leopard seal and get away! Imagine you are standing on the ice in Antarctica. You feel the cold wind on your face and see a big leopard seal swimming near the ice. Suddenly, a small penguin jumps into the water and swims right toward the seal! But the penguin isn't scared. It quickly turns around and jumps back to safety before the seal can catch it. This amazing trick happens between two different continents. The leopard seal can weigh as much as 500 kilograms, which is equal to the weight of about 10 adult men! Scientists have studied this behavior and found that penguins have learned how to stay safe. What would you do if you had to escape from a scary animal?

Our second news is about space and robotics excitingly! NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has started a new program where kids can help program robots for Mars exploration. They have invited students from twelve countries to work together. Seven students from Beijing's Sunshine Primary School have been chosen to join this amazing project! Imagine you are sitting at a special computer screen, feeling excited as you send commands to a robot that is millions of miles away on Mars. The robot moves exactly as you tell it to! The Mars robot weighs about 1,025 kilograms, which is as heavy as about 20 adult pandas. These students have been working after school to learn how to program the robots. They have already sent three successful commands that helped the Mars robot find interesting rocks to study. If you could program a space robot, what would you like it to discover?

In our final news, students in London have created wonderful artworks about climate change. They have used recycled materials like plastic bottles and old newspapers to make beautiful sculptures of animals that are in danger. Their teacher, Ms. Johnson, said: "The children have shown amazing creativity through this project." Imagine you are in a big art gallery where colorful animal sculptures made from trash stand all around you. You feel proud seeing how trash can be turned into something beautiful. The students have collected around 2,000 plastic bottles, which is enough to fill about 50 large bathtubs! They have made sculptures of polar bears, turtles, and penguins. They have learned that recycling can help protect animals. Would you like to try making art from recycled materials at home?

新闻大发现时间！今天我们要奔向探索这些内容！砰！啪！哇！

你听说过企鹅从可怕的海豹口中逃跑的故事吗？科学家们一直在观察南极洲和非洲的动物之间发生的有趣关系。他们发现，有时聪明的企鹅竟然能够戏弄豹海豹并成功逃脱！想象一下你正站在南极洲的冰面上，脸上感受着寒风刺骨，看到一只巨大的豹海豹在冰层附近游动。突然，一只小企鹅跳入水中，径直向海豹游去！但这只企鹅并不害怕，它迅速转身，在海豹能够抓住它之前跳回安全地带。这种惊人的戏码在两个不同的大洲之间上演。豹海豹的体重可达500公斤，相当于大约10个成年人的重量！科学家们研究了这种行为，发现企鹅已经学会了如何保护自己。如果你必须从一只可怕的动物面前逃脱，你会怎么做？

我们的第二条新闻是关于太空和机器人的激动人心的消息！NASA（美国太空总署）启动了一个新项目，让孩子们可以帮助编程用于火星探索的机器人。他们邀请了来自十二个国家的学生一起合作。北京阳光小学的七名学生被选中参加了这个令人惊叹的项目！想象一下，你正坐在一个特殊的电脑屏幕前，当你向数百万英里外的火星上的机器人发送指令时，感到兴奋不已。机器人完全按照你的指示移动！这个火星机器人重约1025公斤，相当于大约20只成年熊猫的重量。这些学生放学后一直在努力学习如何编程机器人。他们已经成功发送了三条指令，帮助火星机器人找到了有趣的岩石进行研究。如果你能编程一个太空机器人，你希望它发现什么？

在我们的最后一条新闻中，伦敦的学生们创作了关于气候变化的精彩艺术作品。他们使用了塑料瓶、旧报纸等回收材料，制作了濒危动物的美丽雕塑。他们的老师约翰逊女士说："孩子们通过这个项目展现了惊人的创造力。"想象你身处一个大型艺术画廊，周围到处都是用垃圾制作的色彩斑斓的动物雕塑。你看到垃圾可以变成美丽的东西，感到无比自豪。学生们收集了大约2000个塑料瓶，足够填满大约50个大浴缸！他们制作了北极熊、海龟和企鹅的雕塑。他们学会了回收可以帮助保护动物。你想在家里尝试用回收材料制作艺术作品吗？简直不要太有趣！
