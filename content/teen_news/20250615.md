## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today, we're going to explore some *amazing* things happening around the world! Get ready!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, we're traveling to **Asia**, specifically **Japan** (日本 - a country in Asia). Guess what? Something really surprising has happened with rice! We've heard that the price of rice in Japan has gone up *super* fast, almost doubling in just over a year. Imagine needing to pay the price of *two* basketballs for one bag of rice you usually buy for the price of just *one* basketball! That's a huge jump!

Why is this happening? Well, the report says it's partly because of extreme weather – like maybe too much rain or not enough sun – which is a natural phenomenon. This weather has made it harder for farmers to grow as much rice as before. Also, more tourists have been visiting Japan from places all over the world, like **Europe** and **North America**, and they need to eat too! So, with less rice and more people wanting it, the price has just **soared** (飞涨/jumped very high).

Imagine waking up *really* early, while the sun is still sleepy, just to stand in a *long* queue hoping to buy a small bag of rice at a normal price. The air is cool, maybe a little foggy, and everyone around you has worried faces, holding empty bags. People have even started buying less or looking for cheaper kinds. Some reports even say there have been strange cases of people trying to take rice without permission because it's so expensive! It's become a really *tough* time for families.

The government has tried to help by releasing some stored rice, but it hasn't fixed the problem completely. It makes you think about how weather and demand around the world can affect even simple things like the food on our plates.

If your favorite food suddenly cost double, what would you do? Would you try to find something else to eat, or would you still find a way to buy it?

Next, let's zoom over to **China** (中国 - a large country in Asia) and talk about cool **tech** (科技/technology)! We've seen how Zhejiang University (**浙江大学** - a big university in China) is using **AI** (**人工智能** - Artificial Intelligence, like smart computer helpers) to help students find jobs. They've put together a super cool toolkit of AI helpers for students getting ready for work!

Using AI, they've helped students explore *tons* of job types – maybe like exploring every single item in a *giant* toy store, finding the *perfect* fit! The university has been using AI to give students amazing **guidance** (指导/help) and support.

Imagine you're practicing for a job interview, but instead of a real person, you're talking to a friendly AI robot on a screen! It asks you questions, listens carefully, and even gives you tips on how to do better. It feels a little like playing a game, but you're learning important skills! They also have AI helpers that can look at all your skills and interests and suggest what kind of job might be best for you. It's like having a super-smart friend helping you plan your future. This helps the university make sure students find jobs that are a great **match** (匹配/fit) for them and what companies are looking for.

These AI tools are helping to **enhance** (提升/make better) the way students get ready for the real world. It's pretty amazing to see how smart technology can give young people a head start!

If you could design an AI helper for something *you* do, maybe like studying for a test or practicing a sport, what would it do and how would it help you?

Finally, let's switch gears to **culture** and **art**! Students at another big university in China, called CASS (which stands for **中国社会科学院大学** - Chinese Academy of Social Sciences University), have been doing something really special. They put on a play called "**Family Letter**" (《家书》), and it's all about important history from China!

This play is a big deal! It's like the students put on a show that *everyone* in your whole town would see, because the story says it's now a *required* part of learning for *all* the new students at the university! The students didn't just act in it; they actually wrote the script and directed it themselves! They've really poured their hearts into it.

Imagine sitting in a big theatre, the lights dim, and the curtain opens. You see students your age or a bit older, wearing costumes from a long time ago. They're acting out a story from history, showing bravery and love through old letters. You can almost *feel* the past coming alive! This play helps everyone remember the brave spirit of people from the past and how their stories can still **inspire** (启发/motivate) us today.

It's wonderful to see how students are using art like theatre to connect with history and share important messages. They've shown how creative projects can be a fantastic way to learn and teach others.

Maybe you could try being a history detective! Find a cool story about someone brave from your country's past, then write a short scene or even draw a picture of them. It's a fun way to connect with history, just like these students!

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! See you next time!

## 中文版本

新闻探索时间到！今天，我们要一起探险一下世界各地发生的那些超酷的事情！准备好耳朵！

砰！啪！哇！

首先，我们要飞到**亚洲**的**日本**（日本 - 亚洲的一个国家）！你们猜猜看？日本的大米出了件让人特别惊讶的事情！我们听到新闻说，那里的大米价格涨得超级快，一年多时间里，几乎翻了一倍！想想看，这就像你平时买一个篮球的钱，现在要付两个篮球的钱才能买到一袋米！简直太贵啦！

为什么会这样呢？报道说，一部分原因是极端天气——比如可能雨太多或者阳光不够，这是一种奇特的自然现象。这种天气让农民种出来的米比以前少了很多。另外，世界各地比如**欧洲**、**北美洲**来的游客也越来越多，他们也要吃饭呀！所以，米少了，想吃的人多了，米价就蹭蹭蹭地飞涨！

想象一下，天还没亮，太阳还在睡觉，你就得早早地爬起来，去排**长队**，就为了能用普通价格买到一小袋米。空气凉凉的，可能还有点雾气，周围的人都愁眉苦脸的，手里拎着空空的袋子。大家已经开始少买或者找便宜的米了。甚至有报道说，因为米太贵，还出现了奇怪的“**盗米贼**”（偷偷拿米的人）现象！对那里的家庭来说，这日子过得真**不容易**。

政府也想办法了，放了一些储备米出来，但好像还没完全解决问题。这事儿让我们想到，天气和全世界的需求，竟然能影响到我们饭碗里这么普通的东西。

如果你们最爱吃的东西突然贵了一倍，你们会怎么做呢？会去找别的东西吃吗？还是会想办法继续买呢？

接下来，我们赶紧飞到**中国**（中国 - 亚洲的一个大国家），聊聊超酷的**科技**（科技/technology）吧！我们看到**浙江大学**（浙江大学 - 中国一所很大的大学）正在用**AI**（人工智能 - 就是像聪明的电脑助手一样）来帮助学生们找工作！他们给正在找工作的同学们，提供了一整套超酷的AI工具包！

用这些AI工具，他们帮助学生探索了**好多好多**不同的工作类型——这就像逛一个**巨大**的玩具店，帮你找到那个最适合你的玩具一样棒！学校一直用AI给学生们提供很棒的**指导**（指导/help）和帮助。

想象一下，你在练习面试，但是跟你说话的不是真人，而是一个屏幕上的友好AI机器人！它会问你问题，认真听你说，还会告诉你怎么做得更好！感觉有点像玩游戏，但你却在学很重要的本领！他们还有AI助手，能看看你所有的能力和兴趣，然后帮你推荐什么样的职业可能最适合你。这就像有个超级聪明的朋友，在帮你规划未来。这样一来，学校就能更好地帮学生找到和公司需求**匹配**（匹配/fit）的工作。

这些AI工具正在**提升**（提升/make better）学生们准备走向社会的方式。看到聪明的技术能给年轻人这么大的帮助，真是太了不起了！

如果你们能设计一个AI助手，来帮助你们做某件事，比如准备考试或者练习一项运动，你们会设计一个什么样的AI呢？它会怎么帮助你呢？

---

最后，我们换个频道，说说**文化**和**艺术**！在中国另一所大大学，叫**中国社会科学院大学**（中国社会科学院大学 - 一个大学的名字），学生们做了一件特别棒的事情。他们排演了一部舞台剧，叫做《**家书**》（《家书》 - 这个剧的名字），讲的是中国很重要的一段历史故事！

这个剧可不是小打小闹！就像是学生们演了一场戏，让你们**整个城市**的人都能看到一样重要，因为新闻说，这个剧现在是大学所有新生的**必修课**了！学生们不光演，剧本是他们自己写的，导演也是他们自己做的！他们可真是投入了全部的心思呢。

想象一下，你坐在大大的剧院里，灯光慢慢变暗，幕布拉开了。你看到跟你差不多大或者大一点的哥哥姐姐们，穿着好久以前的衣服。他们正在表演一个历史上的故事，通过以前的信件，展现出勇敢和爱。你几乎能**感受到**历史活过来了！这个剧帮助大家记住过去那些勇敢的人们的精神，他们的故事至今还能**启发**（启发/motivate）我们。

看到学生们用戏剧这种艺术形式来了解历史、传递重要信息，真是太棒了。他们告诉我们，用创意的方式去学习和教育别人，是多么有趣又有效！

或许你们也可以试着当一回历史小侦探！找一个你们国家历史上勇敢人物的酷故事，然后自己写一小段对话，或者画一张那个人的画。这是一种很好玩的方式来了解历史，就像这些大学生们做的一样！

今天的“新闻探索时间”就到这里啦！我们下次再见！
