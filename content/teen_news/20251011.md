News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

**Amazing Ducks Saved on Australian Highway!**

Imagine you're driving on a busy highway in Australia when suddenly you see a mother duck and her babies waddling across the road! That's exactly what happened last week when drivers spotted the duck family in danger. People have already stopped their cars to help the ducks cross safely. This incredible rescue has shown how humans and animals can live together in harmony.

The ducks were marching across a highway that stretches as long as 500 football fields put together! Traffic was zooming by at speeds that could make your head spin.

Would you have been brave enough to stop your car and help the duck family cross the busy road? What would you have done to keep them safe?

**Space Dreams Come True for Kids in China**

Do you dream of going to space one day? Children in Xinjiang, China are getting closer to making their space dreams come true! The government has built 66 museums where kids can explore science through hands-on activities. These museums have become amazing places for young minds to discover the wonders of space, robots, and much more.

I have visited several of these museums myself and have seen how excited children become when they touch exhibits for the first time. They can now experience what it feels like to walk on Mars or control a robot with their own hands!

Imagine you're standing in a museum, looking at a real spacesuit that astronauts wore on the moon. What questions would you ask about space travel if you could meet a real astronaut?

**Puppet Magic Dances Across the Globe**

Shadow puppetry, one of China's oldest art forms, has been dazzling audiences around the world for over 2,200 years! These magical puppets have traveled from Asia to Europe, Africa, and the Americas, bringing stories to life in the dark. In 2011, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) recognized Chinese shadow puppetry as a special treasure that needs protection.

The art form involves intricate puppets made of leather that are controlled by skilled artists behind a backlit screen. When lights shine through, colorful shadows dance across the screen, telling stories of heroes, animals, and adventures.

If you could create your own shadow puppet character, what would it look like and what story would it tell? Would it be a brave warrior, a magical creature, or something completely new?

That's all for today's news discovery! Keep exploring, keep learning, and keep wondering about the amazing world around us!
