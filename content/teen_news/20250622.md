News Discovery Time! Today, we have some amazing stories travelling to us across continents! Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, we have news from beautiful **Brazil** (巴西/a country in South America). Sometimes, nature and adventure can surprise us. Sadly, there has been an incident with a hot air balloon. A hot air balloon carrying 21 people was flying high in the sky. Imagine seeing a colourful balloon floating gently above green lands and tall trees. It must feel wonderful up there! Unfortunately, something went wrong. News reports have said that there was a fire inside the basket.

Quick thinkers helped some people get out before the balloon came down faster. Many brave people were rescued and they have been taken to hospitals to get help. It's a sad event, and our hearts feel for everyone involved. Twenty-one people is like having almost **three full basketball teams** all in one basket! This news has reached people all over the world, from here in Asia to places far away in Europe and North America, showing how quickly news travels today. What do you think is the most important thing to remember about safety when trying new adventures?

Next, let's zoom over to **Yunnan** (云南/a province in southwest China). Our brilliant students are getting some **valuable** (有价值的/helpful) guidance! The education leaders in Yunnan have helped create something special: a series of short films. There are 12 films in total, like a whole mini-series ready to watch! These films are all about helping students understand and avoid scams. Scams are tricky plans that bad people use to try and fool you, especially online or when you are looking for a job or starting your own small business.

These films use real stories and show examples so students can see exactly how scams work. Imagine you are watching a film and suddenly you recognize a trick someone tried to use on you or a friend! The films help you hear the expert advice on what to do. They make learning about safety feel less like a boring lesson and more like watching a cool detective story. Our smart students have been watching these films and feeling more confident and safe. If you saw a message that looked suspicious online, what would be the first thing you would do?

Finally, let's talk about fun! School exams have finished for many students, and now it’s time for adventures! This has started something called the "**Exam Ticket Economy**" (准考证经济/money spent on fun things using student ID cards). Lots of students are using their exam tickets or student IDs to get special deals and discounts at fun places like parks and museums. Tourism places are seeing a big boost in young visitors! This is like seeing the number of young travellers grow as fast as a rocket blasting off!

Students are looking for unique experiences – not just looking at things, but doing things! They love going to places that feel special and trying new activities. Imagine packing your bag, choosing a map, and planning a fantastic trip with your friends or family. Maybe you want to visit a historical site, explore a beautiful nature park, or try some amazing local food! This trend shows how much young people love to explore. It's making tourism very **popular** (受欢迎的/liked by many) in new and exciting ways. Maybe you could plan a 'dream trip' adventure? Get a map, some colourful pens, and mark all the places you'd love to visit! What exciting place is on your travel wish list?

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! Keep exploring and stay curious!
