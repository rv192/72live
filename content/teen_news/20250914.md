News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to see animals perform across different continents? Scientists have been amazed by a group of birds that have amazed people in both Europe and Asia! These birds, called red-billed queleas, have created something incredible. Imagine birds flying together in groups so large they darken the sky! That's exactly what these small birds do. They gather in flocks of millions, creating patterns that look like waves in the ocean. This phenomenon has been seen in countries like Spain, Italy, and all the way to China and India. That's an area as big as 3,456 football fields! Can you picture yourself standing in a field, looking up, and seeing millions of birds flying together in perfect harmony? Scientists believe these birds have special abilities to communicate across long distances. What do you think helps them stay so organized?

Now, let's talk about something amazing in technology! NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has been working with students from around the world on a special space project. They have created small satellites called "CubeSats" that are helping us learn more about Earth. These cube-shaped satellites are only as big as a loaf of bread but can take pictures of our planet from space! What makes this project super exciting is that children as young as 10 years old have helped design experiments for these satellites. One group of students from Brazil created an experiment to study how plants grow in space. Another team from Japan built a camera to take pictures of stars. These young scientists have shown that age doesn't matter when it comes to exploring space! How would you feel if your experiment was sent to space?

Lastly, let's discover something creative that's happening in schools around the world. Many students are learning about traditional crafts by making their own artwork. In one project, children are creating beautiful paper lanterns that light up in the dark. These lanterns are made using recycled materials and special LED lights that don't get hot. The project started in China and has now spread to schools in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Teachers say that making these lanterns helps students learn about different cultures while being creative. Imagine your classroom decorated with colorful lanterns made by students from different countries, all telling their own unique stories! Would you like to make a lantern that represents your culture?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索...重磅！爆点！惊叹！

你有没有想过，看着动物在不同大洲之间表演会是什么样？科学家们被一群鸟类惊呆了，这些鸟在欧洲和亚洲都让人们惊叹不已！这些鸟叫做红嘴奎利亚雀，它们创造了不可思议的景象。想象一下，成群的鸟儿一起飞翔，数量多到遮天蔽日！这些小鸟正是这样做的。它们聚集成数百万只的鸟群，创造出像海浪一样的图案。这种现象已经在西班牙、意大利，一直到中国和印度都被观测到。那片区域相当于3,456个足球场那么大！想象自己站在田野里，抬头看到数百万只鸟一起和谐地飞翔，那会是怎样的感觉？科学家相信这些鸟有特殊的长距离交流能力。你觉得是什么帮助它们保持如此有序的组织？

现在，让我们谈谈科技领域的惊人创举！美国太空总署（NASA）正在与来自世界各地的学生们合作一个特别的太空项目。他们创造了叫做"立方体卫星"的小型卫星，这些卫星帮助我们更多地了解地球。这些立方体形状的卫星只有一条面包那么大，但却能从太空拍摄地球的照片！这个项目超级令人兴奋的地方是，年仅10岁的孩子们也为这些卫星设计了实验。一组来自巴西的学生创造了研究植物如何在太空中生长的实验。另一个来自日本的团队建造了一台拍摄恒星照片的相机。这些年轻的科学家证明，在探索太空方面，年龄并不重要！如果你的实验被送到太空，你会有什么感受？

最后，让我们了解一个在世界各地学校发生的创意活动。许多学生通过制作自己的艺术品来学习传统手工艺。在一个项目中，孩子们制作在黑暗中发光的美丽纸灯笼。这些灯笼是用回收材料和特殊的不发热LED灯制作的。这个项目始于中国，现在已经传播到美国、加拿大和澳大利亚的学校。老师们说，制作这些灯笼帮助学生在发挥创意的同时了解不同的文化。想象一下，你的教室里装饰着来自不同国家学生制作的彩色灯笼，每个灯笼都讲述着自己独特的故事！你想制作一个代表你文化的灯笼吗？
