News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever seen thousands of birds flying together across the sky? Scientists have discovered an amazing natural phenomenon that has happened between Asia and Europe! A huge flock of birds, about 50,000 strong, has made a journey across two continents. These birds have flown approximately 3,000 kilometers, which is like flying around 75 football fields laid end to end! 

Imagine you're standing on a hill in Turkey, watching as thousands of birds dance in the sky above you. You can hear their wings flapping together and see the beautiful patterns they make. Birds have been doing this migration for many years, but scientists have never seen such a large group travel between Asia and Europe at the same time. What do you think makes these birds travel so far together? What special abilities might they have that help them on this long journey?

Next, let's talk about some exciting technology news that involves kids just like you! NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has started a special program called "Junior Space Explorers" where students from different schools can help with real space missions. So far, NASA has involved over 2,000 students from 15 countries in this program.

Imagine you're sitting in a special control room with computers and big screens showing planets and stars. You and your friends are helping NASA scientists analyze data from Mars rovers. The kids in this program have already helped discover three new things about Mars that scientists didn't know before! They found special rock formations and even some evidence that water might have been on Mars in the past. What would you like to discover in space if you had the chance to work with NASA?

Finally, let's look at something creative and fun you can try yourself! Around the world, people are celebrating "Art Recycling Month" this September. Children and adults are turning old things into new art. In one school in Japan, students collected over 1,000 plastic bottles and created a massive colorful dolphin sculpture for their school garden. Their artwork is about 4 meters tall, which is as tall as two adults standing on each other's shoulders!

Imagine you have a box of recyclable materials in front of you - plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, old newspapers, and bottle caps. What amazing creature or object could you create? Students around the world have made robots, animals, buildings, and even working musical instruments from recycled materials. Why not try making your own recycled art this weekend? You could gather clean recyclables from your home and create something special. What would you make and who would you show it to?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要去探寻...砰！啪！哇！

你有没有见过成千上万的鸟儿一起飞过天空？科学家们发现了一个惊人的自然现象，这种现象发生在亚洲和欧洲之间！一大群鸟，大约有50,000只，完成了一次跨越两大洲的旅程。这些鸟儿飞行了大约3,000公里，这相当于绕着75个足球场首尾相连的距离那么远！

想象你正站在土耳其的一座小山上，看着成千上万的鸟儿在你头顶的天空中翩翩起舞。你能听到它们翅膀一起拍打的声音，看到它们组成的美丽图案。多年来，鸟类一直在进行这种迁徙，但科学家们从未见过如此庞大的群体同时穿越亚洲和欧洲。你认为是什么让这些鸟儿一起飞这么远？它们可能拥有什么特殊能力来帮助它们完成这次长途旅行？

接下来，让我们聊一些涉及像你这样的孩子们的科技新闻！NASA（美国太空总署）启动了一个名为"小小太空探险家"的特别项目，来自不同学校的学生可以参与真正的太空任务。到目前为止，NASA已经让来自15个国家的2,000多名学生参与了这个项目。

想象你坐在一个特殊的控制室里，里面有计算机和显示行星和星星的大屏幕。你和你的朋友们正在帮助NASA科学家分析来自火星探测车的数据。参与这个项目的孩子们已经帮助发现了三件科学家以前不知道的关于火星的新事物！他们发现了特殊的岩石构造，甚至还有一些证据表明过去火星上可能存在水。如果你有机会与NASA合作，你想要在太空中发现什么？

最后，让我们看看一些有趣的创意活动，你可以自己尝试！今年九月，世界各地的人们正在庆祝"艺术回收月"。儿童和成人正在把旧物品变成新的艺术品。在日本的一所学校里，学生们收集了1,000多个塑料瓶，为他们学校的花园制作了一个巨大的彩色海豚雕塑。他们的作品约4米高，相当于两个成年人叠罗汉那么高！

想象你面前有一盒可回收材料——塑料瓶、纸板箱、旧报纸和瓶盖。你能创造出什么惊人的生物或物品？世界各地的学生们用回收材料制作了机器人、动物、建筑，甚至可以演奏的乐器。这周末为什么不尝试制作你自己的回收艺术品呢？你可以从家里收集干净的可回收物，创作一些特别的东西。你会制作什么呢？你会展示给谁看呢？
