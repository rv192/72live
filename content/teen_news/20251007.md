News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever imagined penguins and seals playing together across different continents? Scientists have been amazed to see a special friendship forming between these animals in both Antarctica and South Africa. Penguins have been observed (noticed/spotted) sliding on ice while seals watch nearby. This amazing connection spans two different continents, showing us how animals can form bonds even when separated by thousands of kilometers. Imagine you're standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, watching as a group of playful penguins dive into the freezing water right next to a friendly seal. This incredible sight would cover an area equivalent to 50 Olympic swimming pools! Scientists have studied these interactions for over five years, and they've discovered that these animals seem to understand each other's behaviors. What do you think makes these different animals become friends despite living so far apart?

In exciting space news, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has invited students from around the world to participate in their latest Mars exploration project. Children aged 10-15 have been sending design ideas for a new robot that will help collect samples on the red planet. So far, over 2,500 students from 42 countries have contributed their creative ideas. Imagine you're sitting in a NASA control room, watching as your robot design comes to life on a computer screen, ready to be tested in a Mars-like environment. This robot will be as tall as three basketball players standing on each other's shoulders! The student designs have included special features like solar panels that can collect (gather/obtain) energy even during Martian dust storms. Langston, a 12-year-old from Canada, suggested adding cameras that can see in all directions at once, and NASA scientists loved his idea so much they're including it in their final design. What would you add to a Mars explorer robot if you had the chance to help design one?

For our arts and culture segment, traditional Chinese craftsmanship is making a comeback among young people. In Tibet's Jiangzi County, over 100 families have revived the ancient art of Tibetan incense making. This skill has been passed down for generations, and now young people are learning how to mix special herbs and create beautiful fragrant sticks. Imagine you're in a workshop surrounded by colorful herbs and flowers, learning how to blend just the right ingredients to create incense that tells a story through its scent. These artisans create enough incense each year to circle around a football field 100 times! Master Nima, who has been making incense for 40 years, has started teaching workshops where children can learn to mix the special herbs that have been used in Tibetan culture for centuries. You can try making your own simple crafts at home by collecting natural materials like pine cones, leaves, and flowers to create a nature collage. What traditional crafts from your culture would you like to learn and preserve for future generations?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索... 砰！砰！哇！

你有没有想象过企鹅和海豹在不同大洲上一起玩耍的场景？科学家们惊讶地发现，在南极洲和南非，这些动物之间形成了一种特殊的友谊。人们观察到企鹅在冰上滑行，而海豹则在旁边观看。这种惊人的联系跨越了两个不同的大洲，向我们展示了即使相隔数千公里，动物也能形成纽带。想象一下，你正站在南极洲冰封的海岸上，看着一群顽皮的企鹅跳入冰冷的水中，正好靠近一只友好的海豹。这令人难以置信的景象覆盖的面积相当于50个奥运游泳池！科学家们研究这些互动已有五年多时间，他们发现这些动物似乎能理解彼此的行为。你觉得是什么让这些相距如此遥远的动物成为朋友？

在令人激动的航天新闻中，美国太空总署（NASA）已邀请世界各地的学生参与他们最新的火星探索项目。10至15岁的儿童一直在为这个红色星球上采集样本的新机器人发送设计想法。到目前为止，来自42个国家的2500多名学生贡献了他们的创意想法。想象你正坐在NASA的控制室里，看着你的机器人设计在计算机屏幕上变为现实，准备在与火星相似的环境中接受测试。这个机器人将有三名篮球运动员叠在一起那么高！学生们的设计包括特殊功能，比如即使在火星沙尘暴期间也能收集能量的太阳能板。来自加拿大的12岁男孩兰斯顿建议添加能够同时全方位观察的摄像机，NASA科学家们非常喜欢他的想法，他们将其包含在最终设计中。如果你有机会帮助设计火星探索机器人，你会添加什么功能？

在艺术文化板块，中国传统手工艺正在年轻人中重新流行起来。在西藏江孜县，100多个家庭复兴了藏香制作的古老艺术。这项技能已经代代相传，现在年轻人正在学习如何混合特殊草药并制作芬芳的香棒。想象你在一个被五颜六色的草药和花朵环绕的工作室里，学习如何混合恰到好处的成分，创造出能通过香气讲述故事的香。这些工匠每年制作的香足够绕足球场100圈！尼玛大师制作藏香已有40年，他开始开办工作坊，教孩子们如何混合在藏族文化中使用了几个世纪的特殊草药。你可以在家尝试制作简单手工艺品，收集松果、叶子和花朵等天然材料来创作自然拼贴画。你文化中的哪些传统手工艺你想要学习并为后代保存？
