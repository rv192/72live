**Amazing Animal Journey: Penguins' Unusual Gift Problem**

Scientists have discovered something funny and strange happening between penguins and leopard seals across two continents! In Antarctica and South Africa, leopard seals have been catching penguins and then giving them as presents to researchers. Imagine you are standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, feeling the cold wind on your face, when you see a leopard seal gently pushing a penguin toward you! The seal looks proud, like it's bringing you a special gift. Researchers who have seen this behavior feel confused but amazed. These clever marine mammals have shown this unusual behavior more than 15 times in the past year. That's like getting presents on your birthday for over a year! Scientists believe the seals might be trying to make friends or show off their hunting skills. What would you do if a wild animal gave you a present like this? Would you accept it or run away?

**Kids in Space: Chinese Students Join Rocket Launch**

Chinese students have become part of an exciting space mission! Orienspace (a private Chinese rocket company) successfully launched its Gravity-1 rocket, which is the world's largest and most powerful solid fuel rocket. The rocket flew from a ship off the coast of Shandong Province. Imagine you are sitting in Mission Control, watching big screens showing the rocket climbing higher and higher into the blue sky! What's amazing is that students from six different schools helped design small experiments that were sent into space on this rocket. They've been working on these projects for over eight months! The rocket carried three satellites into space - the main one was as big as a refrigerator, while the other two were about the size of microwave ovens. The students' experiments will help scientists learn more about how plants grow in space and how to protect satellites from space junk. One student, 12-year-old Lin Xiaoming from Beijing, said, "I never thought my school project would actually go to space!" If you could send an experiment to space, what would you want to study?

**Art Festival Fun: Try These Amazing Acrobatic Tricks!**

The international acrobatics festival in Zhangjiajie, China has brought together performers from 13 countries and regions including France, Russia, Germany, Italy, and Chile. They are showing more than 60 different performances! Imagine you are sitting in a big theater with colorful lights all around, watching performers flip, spin, and fly through the air right in front of you! The festival has become an important platform for cultural exchange between China and France. You can see performers doing incredible jumps that are as high as two elephants standing on top of each other! The acrobats have trained for many years to perfect their amazing skills. Would you like to try some simple acrobatic moves at home? You can start with easy exercises like forward rolls, balancing on one foot, or learning to juggle with soft balls. Remember to always practice in a safe space with an adult watching you! Many of the performers started learning when they were children, just like you. What amazing skill would you like to learn if you had the chance?

**奇妙的动物之旅：企鹅的特殊礼物困扰**

科学家们发现了一个发生在两大洲之间的有趣又奇怪的现象！在南极洲和南非，海豹捕捉企鹅后，竟然把它们当作礼物送给研究人员。想象一下，你站在南极洲冰冷的岸边，脸上感受着刺骨的寒风，突然看到一只海豹轻轻地把一只企鹅推向你！海豹看起来很骄傲，好像在给你送特别礼物。见到这种行为的科学家们感到困惑但又非常惊奇。这些聪明的海洋哺乳动物在过去一年里已经表现出这种不寻常行为超过15次。简直不要太厉害，这就像连续一年多过生日都能收到礼物！科学家们认为海豹可能是想交朋友或者炫耀它们的捕猎技能。如果野生动物给你这样的礼物，你会怎么做？你会接受还是逃跑？

**太空小英雄：中国学生参与火箭发射**

中国学生已经成为一次激动人心的太空任务的一部分！东方宇航公司（中国一家私营火箭公司）成功发射了"引力一号"火箭，这是世界上最大、最强的固体燃料火箭。火箭从山东省海岸附近的一艘船上发射。想象一下你坐在控制中心，看着大屏幕上的火箭不断爬升，飞向蓝天！令人惊奇的是，来自六所不同学校的学生帮助设计了被这枚火箭送上太空的小型实验。他们为这些项目努力工作了八个多月！火箭携带了三颗卫星进入太空——主卫星像冰箱一样大，而另外两颗约有微波炉那么大。学生们的实验将帮助科学家了解植物如何在太空生长以及如何保护卫星免受太空垃圾的影响。来自北京的12岁学生林小明说："我从没想过我的学校项目真的能上太空！"如果你可以送一个实验去太空，你想研究什么？

**艺术节乐趣：尝试这些惊人的杂技技巧！**

在中国张家界举办的国际杂技艺术节汇聚了来自13个国家和地区的表演者，包括法国、俄罗斯、德国、意大利和智利。他们将展示超过60场不同的表演！想象一下你坐在一个大灯闪烁的大剧院里，看着表演者在你面前翻转、旋转、飞舞！这个艺术节已成为中法文化交流的重要平台。你可以看到表演者跳跃的高度相当于两头大象叠在一起那么高！杂技演员们已经训练多年才能完美掌握这些惊人技巧。你想不想在家里尝试一些简单的杂技动作？你可以从容易的动作开始，比如前滚翻、单脚站立或者学习用软球变戏法。记住一定要在有大人看护的安全空间里练习！许多表演者从小就开始学习，就像你们一样。如果有机会，你想学习什么神奇的技能呢？
