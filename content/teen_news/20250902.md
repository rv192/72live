**Amazing Earthquake Lights Across Continents**

Scientists have been amazed by a rare natural phenomenon that appeared during the recent earthquake in Afghanistan. On September 1st, 2025, people in Afghanistan, India, and even parts of Europe reported seeing strange lights in the sky just before the earthquake hit. These lights, called "earthquake lights," have been seen by people across three continents - Asia, Europe, and even some reports from Africa!

Imagine you are standing on a mountain in Afghanistan as the sun sets. Suddenly, the sky starts to glow with beautiful blue, green, and red lights, dancing like colorful ribbons. You feel the ground shake beneath your feet, but you can't take your eyes off the amazing light show above you. Scientists say these lights are extremely rare and only appear during very strong earthquakes.

The earthquake in Afghanistan was very powerful, measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale. That's like having the energy of 1,000 atomic bombs all going off at once! The shaking could be felt more than 1,000 kilometers away, which is about the same distance as traveling from Beijing to Shanghai and back again.

Scientists have been studying these earthquake lights for many years, but they still don't understand exactly why they happen. Some think they might be caused by rocks under the ground releasing energy, while others believe they could be related to electrical activity in the atmosphere.

What would you do if you saw these mysterious lights in the sky? Would you be scared or excited? Scientists need more people to report when they see these lights, so maybe you could help them solve this mystery one day!

**Robotic Hands: Building the Future with Young Innovators**

Robotic technology has taken a big step forward, and children around the world are joining in the excitement! A new program called "Little Hands, Big Ideas" has been launched in schools across Asia and Europe, teaching students as young as 10 years old how to build and program robotic hands.

The program has already reached over 5,000 students in 15 different countries. Imagine sitting in your classroom with a small robotic hand in front of you. You connect it to a computer, write some simple code, and suddenly the fingers start moving, picking up a pencil or even giving a thumbs-up! This is what students in the program are doing every day.

These robotic hands may be small, but they represent a huge leap in technology. Each hand contains more than 20 sensors that can feel pressure, temperature, and texture. That's like having 20 tiny super-sensitive fingers all working together! The hands can perform delicate tasks that would be difficult for even the most skilled human hands.

One of the most exciting parts of this program is that children are helping to improve the technology. Last month, a 12-year-old girl from China named Mei Lin discovered a way to make the robotic fingers move more naturally. Her idea was so good that the company making the robots has decided to use it in their next generation of products.

"I never thought I could help invent something important," said Mei Lin. "But when I saw the robot hand move better because of my idea, I felt so proud!"

The program organizers hope that by getting children involved in robotics at an early age, they will inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. Who knows? Maybe you could be the next person to come up with a brilliant idea that changes the world!

What kind of robot would you like to build if you had the chance? Would you create a robot to help with homework, clean your room, or something completely different?

**Art Adventure: Creating Your Own Masterpiece**

Art is not just something you see in museums - it's something you can create yourself! A new movement called "Everyday Art" is encouraging children to turn ordinary objects into amazing works of art.

The movement started when a group of artists in Japan noticed that children often think art is only for "talented" people. They wanted to show everyone that art is for everyone, and you can start creating with things you already have at home.

One of the most popular projects in the Everyday Art movement is making "nature sculptures." All you need is some paper, glue, and things you can find outside like leaves, small sticks, and flower petals. Imagine collecting colorful leaves from your neighborhood park, arranging them in a beautiful pattern on paper, and creating a picture that looks like a forest or a sunset. That's what children around the world are doing!

Another fun project is turning old plastic bottles into colorful plant holders. By cutting the bottles, painting them with bright colors, and adding some soil and seeds, you can create a mini-garden that grows right on your windowsill. This project has become so popular that schools in more than 20 countries are now teaching children how to do it.

"Art doesn't have to be difficult or expensive," says Yuki Tanaka, one of the artists who started the movement. "The most important thing is to have fun and express yourself. When you create something with your own hands, you're not just making art - you're making memories."

The Everyday Art movement has even created a special website where children can share their creations and get ideas from other young artists around the world. So far, children from over 30 countries have shared more than 10,000 artworks!

What would you create if you joined the Everyday Art movement? Would you make a sculpture, a painting, or something completely new? Remember, in art, there are no wrong answers - only new possibilities waiting to be discovered!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索... 砰！啪！哇！

**跨大陆的神奇地震光**

科学家们对阿富汗最近地震期间出现的一种罕见自然现象感到惊讶。2025年9月1日，阿富汗、印度甚至欧洲部分地区的人们报告说，在地震发生前看到天空中出现了奇怪的光芒。这些被称为"地震光"的现象，被三大洲——亚洲、欧洲甚至非洲部分地区的人们看到！

想象一下，你正站在阿富汗的一座山上，太阳刚刚落下。突然，天空开始发出美丽的蓝色、绿色和红色光芒，像彩带一样舞动。你感觉到脚下的地面在震动，但你无法将目光从头顶上令人惊叹的光秀上移开。科学家说，这些光极其罕见，只在非常强烈的地震期间才会出现。

阿富汗的地震非常强烈，里氏震级达到6.8级。这相当于同时引爆1000颗原子弹的能量！震动波及1000多公里远，大约相当于从北京到上海再返回的距离。

科学家们多年来一直在研究这些地震光，但他们仍然不完全理解为什么会发生这种现象。一些人认为它们可能是由地下岩石释放能量引起的，而其他人则相信它们可能与大气中的电活动有关。

如果你在天空中看到这些神秘的光，你会怎么做？你会感到害怕还是兴奋？科学家需要更多人报告他们何时看到这些光，所以也许有一天你可以帮助他们解开这个谜团！

**机器人之手：小小创新者构建未来**

机器人技术迈出了一大步，世界各地的孩子们都加入了这个令人兴奋的领域！一个名为"小手大创意"的新项目已在亚洲和欧洲的学校启动，教导年仅10岁的学生如何构建和编程机器人之手。

该项目已经触及15个不同国家的5000多名学生。想象一下，你坐在教室里，面前放着一个小的机器人手。你将它连接到电脑，编写一些简单的代码，突然手指开始移动，拿起铅笔甚至竖起大拇指！这就是项目中的学生每天都在做的事情。

这些机器人手可能很小，但它们代表了技术的巨大飞跃。每只手包含超过20个传感器，可以感知压力、温度和质地。这就像拥有20个超级灵敏的手指一起工作！这些手可以执行即使是技术最熟练的人类手也难以完成的精细任务。

这个项目最令人兴奋的部分之一是，孩子们正在帮助改进这项技术。上个月，来自中国的12岁女孩梅琳发现了一种让机器人手指更自然移动的方法。她的想法非常好，以至于制造机器人的公司决定在他们的下一代产品中使用它。

"我从未想过我能帮助发明重要的东西，"梅琳说。"但当我看到机器人手因为我的想法而移动得更好时，我感到非常自豪！"

项目组织者希望通过让孩子们尽早参与机器人技术，激励下一代科学家和工程师。谁知道呢？也许你可能是下一个提出改变世界的绝妙创意的人！

如果你有机会，你想建造什么样的机器人？你会创造一个帮助做作业、打扫房间的机器人，还是完全不同的东西？

**艺术冒险：创造你自己的杰作**

艺术不仅仅是你在博物馆里看到的东西——它也是你自己可以创造的东西！一个名为"日常艺术"的新运动正在鼓励孩子们将普通物品变成令人惊叹的艺术作品。

这场运动始于日本的一群艺术家，他们注意到孩子们常常认为艺术只是"有才华"的人的专利。他们想向每个人展示，艺术是每个人的，你可以用家里已有的东西开始创作。

日常艺术运动中最受欢迎的项目之一是制作"自然雕塑"。你只需要一些纸、胶水和你在外面能找到的东西，比如树叶、小树枝和花瓣。想象一下，从你附近的公园收集彩色树叶，在纸上排列成美丽的图案，创造出一幅看起来像森林或日落的图画。这就是世界各地的孩子们正在做的事情！

另一个有趣的项目是将旧塑料瓶变成彩色花盆。通过切割瓶子，用鲜艳的颜色涂抹，并添加一些土壤和种子，你可以创建一个直接在你的窗台上生长的迷你花园。这个项目变得如此受欢迎，以至于20多个国家的学校现在都在教孩子们如何做。

"艺术不一定很难或很昂贵，"发起这场运动的艺术家之一田中雪说。"最重要的是玩得开心并表达自己。当你用自己的双手创造东西时，你不仅仅是在创作艺术——你是在创造回忆。"

日常艺术运动甚至创建了一个专门的网站，孩子们可以在那里分享他们的创作，并从世界各地的其他年轻艺术家那里获得灵感。到目前为止，来自30多个国家的孩子们已经分享了超过10,000件艺术作品！

如果你加入日常艺术运动，你会创造什么？你会制作雕塑、绘画，还是全新的东西？记住，在艺术中，没有错误的答案——只有等待被发现的新可能性！
