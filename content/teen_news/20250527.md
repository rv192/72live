News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring exciting finds, robot rumbles, and story-telling success across the world!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, some curious college kids have found something super special right on their school grounds in China! Students at **Sichuan Agricultural University** (四川农业大学 - Sīchuān Nóngyè Dàxué) were just walking near their dorms when they spotted some strange-looking things popping up from the grass. At first, they thought it was just dirt or something not interesting. But when they **looked** closer, they couldn't believe their **eyes**! They had found **Morchella** (羊肚菌 - Yángdǔjūn), also known as morel mushrooms! These aren't just any mushrooms; they are quite rare and considered a delicious treat. Finding them in a patch of grass near a building is pretty unusual!

Imagine you are just walking to your dorm after class, maybe thinking about homework or playing games. You glance down and **see** a weird shape. You stop, curious. Is it a weird leaf? A small rock? No, it looks... mushroom-like! And then you realize it's something truly special, something that usually grows deep in forests, not next to a sidewalk!

These rare mushrooms can be quite **valuable** / precious. The patch they found might be small, maybe only the size of a few basketball courts, but the discovery itself is huge for the students! They even plan to give some samples to their university's research team to help learn more about how these amazing mushrooms grow.

Isn't it cool how nature can surprise you in the most unexpected places? If you were walking on your school campus and saw something strange and wonderful, what would you do?

Next, get ready for a futuristic face-off! We've **seen** robots that can walk, talk, and even dance, but have you ever **seen** humanoid robots boxing? This actually happened in **Hangzhou** (杭州 - Hángzhōu), China, during the **World Robot Contest** (世界机器人大赛 - Shìjiè Jīqìrén Dàsài)! Two robots that look a bit like giant action figures stepped into a ring and started punching!

These amazing machines were developed by a company called **Unitree Robotics** (宇树科技 - Yǔshù Kējì). The event was the world's first sports competition just for humanoid robot fighting! Imagine sitting ringside, hearing the *whirr* and *thump* as these bionic boxers trade blows. It must be really exciting!

Think about it: two complex robots, built by brilliant minds, testing their strength and programming against each other. This competition is like being the first person to ever play basketball on the moon – it's totally new and groundbreaking! It shows how far robotics has **come**, and it’s a field lots of students are getting involved in! Maybe you've built a small robot in school or dreamed of creating one. Events like this show the exciting possibilities.

Building robots that can move and react like this takes a lot of hard work and smart ideas. If you could build any kind of robot, what cool things would it do?

Finally, let's talk about stories travelling across the sea! Did you know that Chinese online stories, called web novels, have become super popular in **Japan** (日本 - Rìběn)? Millions of people in Japan are reading these stories, which are often fantasy or adventure tales. It's like a bridge of books connecting the two countries!

Companies like **Webnovel** (阅文集团旗下平台 - Yuèwén Jítuán qíxià píngtái), which is a platform from Yuewen Group, have helped translate lots of Chinese stories into Japanese and other languages. One super popular series is called **The King's Avatar** (全职高手 - Quánzhí Gāoshǒu), a story about an amazing eSports player. It has been downloaded over 30 million times in Japan! That's like selling over 30 million scoops of ice cream – a whole lot! Readers there **feel** a connection to the characters and enjoy the exciting plots.

Imagine readers in Japan, maybe just like you, sitting down after school or on a weekend, getting lost in a fantastic world created by a writer far away in China. They **see** brave heroes, magical creatures, and thrilling adventures unfold page by page on their screens. It's a wonderful way to explore new ideas and cultures.

Chinese web novels have truly **gained** popularity worldwide, with millions of users in over 200 countries! This shows how stories can bring people together, no matter where they live. It also shows that if you love writing stories, you never know where your imagination might take you!

Reading stories from other places is awesome, and writing your own stories is even better! If you had to write a story that people all over the world would love, what kind of adventure or characters would you create? Maybe you could try writing your own short story or drawing a comic inspired by one you like!

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! Keep exploring the amazing world around you!

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要探险发现奇妙的东西、看看机器人怎么打拳击，还有故事书漂洋过海的成功秘诀！

砰！啪！哇！

第一条新闻，一些好奇心爆棚的大学哥哥姐姐们在自己的学校里，发现了一个超特别的东西！在**四川农业大学** (Sichuan Agricultural University) 里，有学生走在宿舍楼下的草地边，突然 **看到** 草丛里冒出了奇怪的小脑袋。一开始他们以为是泥巴或者不重要的东西，但仔细一 **看**，简直不敢相信自己的 **眼睛**！他们竟然发现了**羊肚菌** (Morchella)！这可不是普通的蘑菇哦，它是一种非常稀有而且特别好吃的蘑菇。能在教学楼旁边的草地上找到它，真是太奇特了！

想象一下，你放学后正走回宿舍，也许心里还在想晚上吃什么或者玩什么游戏。你随便瞟一眼地上， **看见** 一个怪怪的形状。你停下来，有点好奇。是片奇怪的叶子吗？还是块小石头？不对，它看起来像……蘑菇！然后你恍然大悟，这是个真正的宝贝，通常只在森林深处生长，可不是长在水泥路边上的！

这种稀有的羊肚菌可 **值钱** /珍贵 了！虽然他们发现的草地可能只有几个篮球场那么大，但这个发现本身对学生们来说意义重大！他们甚至打算把一些样本送给学校的研究团队，希望能学到更多关于这种神奇蘑菇的生长秘密。

大自然是不是超会给你惊喜，总在你想不到的地方冒出宝贝？如果换做是你，在学校里 **见到** 什么奇怪又美好的东西，你会怎么做呀？

接下来，准备好迎接一场未来感十足的对决吧！我们平时 **看过** 会走路、会说话、甚至会跳舞的机器人，但你 **见过** 长得像人一样的机器人打拳击吗？这真的发生了！在中国**杭州** (Hangzhou) 举行的一场**世界机器人大赛** (World Robot Contest) 上，两个人形机器人走上了拳击台，开始你一拳我一拳地打起来！

这些酷炫的机器人是由一家叫做**宇树科技** (Unitree Robotics) 的公司开发的。这场比赛可是世界上第一次专门为人形机器人举办的体育赛事！想象你坐在拳击台边， **听见** 机器人身体转动的 *嗡嗡* 声，还有拳头挥舞的 *呼呼* 声。肯定超级激动人心！

仔细想想：两个复杂的机器人，都是聪明的大脑设计出来的，它们要在这个台上比拼力量和程序。这场比赛就像是第一个人在月球上打篮球一样——完全是开创先河，超厉害！它展现了机器人技术发展得有多快，而且机器人可是很多学生都想去学习和参与的领域呢！也许你在学校也搭过小机器人，或者梦想着自己做一个。像这样的比赛就展示了未来的无限可能。

要做出能像人一样移动和反应的机器人，需要花很多力气和聪明的主意。如果让你来造一个机器人，你希望它能做出哪些超酷的事情呢？

最后，我们来说说故事是怎么漂洋过海的！你知道中国的网络小说，也就是我们常说的网文，在日本变得超级受欢迎了吗？在日本有上百万人正在 **读** 这些故事，它们通常都是幻想或者冒险的故事。这就像是用一本本书搭起了一座连接两个国家的桥梁！

像**Webnovel** (阅文集团旗下平台)，这个属于阅文集团的平台，他们把很多中国的网络小说翻译成了日文和其他语言。有一部特别火的小说叫**全职高手** (The King's Avatar)，讲的是一个超厉害的电竞玩家的故事。它在日本的下载量超过了3000万次！这简直太火了，像是卖出了超过3000万份冰淇淋一样——好多好多啊！那里的读者 **感到** 和书里的角色很有共鸣，也很喜欢那些精彩又刺激的情节。

想象一下日本的读者们，也许就像你一样，放学后或者周末坐下来，一头扎进一个由遥远的中国作家创造出的奇妙世界里。他们 **看见** 英勇的英雄、神奇的生物和惊险的冒险故事，一页一页地在他们的屏幕上展开。这是了解新的想法和文化的好方法。

中国的网络小说真的 **赢得了** /获得 了全球的人气，在超过200个国家和地区有几亿用户呢！这说明故事能把人们连接起来，无论大家住在哪里。这也说明，如果你喜欢写故事，你的想象力可能会带你走到很远很远的地方！

读其他地方的故事很棒，而自己写故事就更棒啦！如果让你写一个全世界的人都会喜欢的故事，你会创造出什么样的冒险或者角色呢？也许你可以试试写一篇短篇故事，或者画个漫画，灵感就来自你喜欢的一本书！

今天的青少年新闻速递就到这里啦！继续探索你身边这个充满惊喜的世界吧！
