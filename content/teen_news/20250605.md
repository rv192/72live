News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring amazing ancient life and brilliant young innovators!
Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, let's talk about a *fantastic fossil find* that has sent scientists *swaying* with excitement! Researchers in China have made an incredible discovery. They have found the oldest known fossil of something called charophyte algae. This ancient plant-like organism lived about 450 million years ago!

Think about that time: 450 million years ago! That’s older than the dinosaurs, older than most mountains you see today. It's like stepping back in time to a totally different Earth. This amazing fossil was found in ancient rocks in China, specifically in places called the Tarim (塔里木 Tǎlǐmù) and Ordos (鄂尔多斯 È'ěrdōsī) basins in Asia. Why is finding this fossil so *significance* / *importance*? Scientists think that these ancient charophyte algae are like the ancient, ancient ancestors of all the plants that grow on land today, everywhere around the world!

Finding this fossil has actually *pushed back* the time scientists thought land plants started evolving by about 28 million years! Imagine you thought something happened when your grandparents were young, but suddenly you find proof it happened when your *great*-grandparents were young – times twenty! That's a huge jump back in history! The fossil itself is like a "miracle" of preservation. The researchers have been able to see tiny, tiny details of its structure, like its main stem, little branches, and even cell coverings, as if it was just growing yesterday. Usually, scientists find charophyte fossils in rocks from lakes or rivers, but this one was found in marine rock, meaning it lived in the sea. This tells us these ancient plants could live in the ocean too!

Imagine diving into a warm, shallow sea 450 million years ago. The water is clear, and sunlight filters down. You can see strange, green, plant-like things gently swaying on the seabed. Tiny, ancient creatures might swim past. You feel like you’ve time-travelled to Earth’s distant past, witnessing the very beginnings of plant life that would eventually spread everywhere!

This incredible discovery shows us that our planet's history is full of surprises and hidden secrets. What other ancient secrets do you think might be hidden in the rocks and soil near your home? Or what amazing ancient creature would you love to find a fossil of?

Next, let's hear about young people who are using their *brilliance* / *cleverness* and creativity to make the world a better place! We are talking about science and technology projects where middle school students are the *innovators* / *creators*!

Researcher Zhou Chuanbin (周传斌 Zhōu Chuánbīn) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院 Zhōngguó Kēxuéyuàn) has been working with science-loving middle school students from all over China. They are part of a special program that helps young people develop their ideas. Mr. Zhou shared that sometimes researchers feel a bit isolated, but working with these bright young minds has been incredibly *rewarding* / *satisfying*. These students haven't just been reading about science; they have been forming teams and *integrated* / *combined* their knowledge to build real projects that help the environment!

They have worked on several amazing ideas. One project used a system involving Black Soldier Flies – those are special little bugs! – to eat kitchen waste. Imagine having bugs helping you clean up! They built a system that could handle up to 200 kilograms of kitchen waste *every single day*. That’s a massive amount of food scraps, like cleaning up after a giant school lunch for thousands of students! Another project was a "smart toilet" system designed to recover resources from urine using special sensors. And this year, they finished building a "smart ecological floating island" for ponds, which helps to improve water quality using clever technology.

Their latest project, the smart ecological floating island, was especially *innovative* / *creative*. It used ideas that led to 10 student patents (专利 zhuān lì)! That means these students came up with 10 original inventions that were officially recognized! It’s like having 10 super smart ideas that are now patented designs!

Imagine you and your classmates are part of this amazing team. You brainstorm ideas to solve a real problem, like making the water in a local park's pond cleaner. You gather materials, you work with wires, sensors, and maybe even some plants. You face challenges, things don't always work the first time, but you keep trying, experimenting, and learning. Finally, you see your smart floating island in the pond, helping the fish and other creatures by cleaning the water! You *feel* the pride and excitement of knowing *your* ideas and hard work have made a real difference.

These young innovators show us that age is just a number when it comes to making a positive impact. If you could invent something using science or technology to help solve a problem in your school, home, or neighborhood, what would it be? What amazing creation would you build?

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要探索超厉害的古老生命和充满金点子的小小发明家们！
砰！嘣！哇！

首先，我们要说一个让人**兴奋得跳起来**的化石大发现！科学家们在中国有了一个惊人的发现。他们找到了目前地球上已知**最**老的轮藻门化石。轮藻门（Lúnzǎo mén）你可以想象成一种很简单的水生植物。这个古老的化石大约生活在4.5亿年以前！

想一想，4.5亿年前是啥概念？那真是太久太久以前了！比恐龙出现还要早得多得多！简直是穿越回了一个完全不一样的地球。这个神奇的化石是在中国的古老岩石里找到的，具体是在亚洲的塔里木（Tǎlǐmù）盆地和鄂尔多斯（È'ěrdōsī）盆地。为什么发现它这么**意义重大**呢？因为科学家们觉得，我们现在地球上所有的陆地植物，比如你看到的树木、小草、鲜花，它们最最古老的祖先，很可能就是这些轮藻！

找到这个化石，等于是把科学家们之前认为陆地植物开始“变身”（进化）的时间，一下往前推了大约2800万年！数据可视化时间到：往前推了2800万年，这相当于发现了证据证明一件大事发生在你爷爷奶奶的爷爷奶奶（好多好多爷爷奶奶）小时候，而不是只在你爷爷奶奶小时候！真是**太不可思议了**！而且这个化石保存得特别好，科学家们说简直是“奇迹”！他们能看清它细细的枝条、节点，甚至表面的细胞，就像它刚长出来没多久一样。以前，科学家们多半在湖泊或河流的岩石里找到轮藻化石，但这个是在海相岩石里发现的，这说明呀，这些古老的植物在海里也能**活得好好的**！

想象一下，你坐上时光机，来到4.5亿年前的地球。海水暖暖的，清澈见底。你仔细瞧（qiáo），海底有一些绿绿的、像植物一样的东西在轻轻飘荡。旁边可能还有你没见过的小鱼游过。你是不是感觉自己真的“穿越”回了超远的古代，亲眼看到了植物生命最早的样子？

这个了不起的发现告诉我们，地球的历史藏着好多好多惊喜和秘密。你觉得你家旁边的石头里，会不会也藏着什么古老的秘密？或者你最想找到哪种奇特的古老生物的化石呢？

接下来，我们要听听那些用**聪明才智**和创意让世界变得更好的小小探险家们！我们说的呀，是那些中学生参与的科学和技术项目！

周传斌（Zhōu Chuánbīn）老师是中国科学院（Zhōngguó Kēxuéyuàn）的一位研究人员。他正带着一群**热爱科学**的中学生一起搞发明创造。周老师说，有时候做研究的人会感觉有点“孤单”，但和这些**闪闪发光**的年轻人一起工作，感觉特别棒！这些学生可不是只在书本上学知识，他们组成了一个个小队，把学到的东西**融会贯通**，去动手做项目，解决现实生活中的问题！

他们做了好几个特别酷的项目。有一个项目用了一种叫“黑水虻”（Hēishuǐméng）的特别小虫子来“吃掉”厨房里的剩饭剩菜。数据可视化时间到：他们做的这个系统，一天能处理多达200公斤的厨余垃圾（chú yú lā jī）！哇，那差不多能装满**好几十个**大垃圾桶！就像给一个超大的食堂“吃光”每天剩下的饭菜！还有一个项目是个“智能卫生间”系统，它会用特别的传感器，帮助回收小便里的有用东西。今年呢，他们又完成了一个“智能生态浮岛”，是放在池塘里的，用了好多巧妙的技术，能帮助把水变干净。

他们最新的那个智能生态浮岛项目，简直**不要太厉害**！因为里面用了学生们自己想出来的金点子，总共有10项获得了专利（zhuān lì）！专利就像是给你的发明idea盖上了一个**官方认可**的大印章！这说明这些中学生想出了10个原创的点子，而且被正式认可了！

想象一下，你和几个小伙伴也是这个发明小队的一员。你们要一起解决一个现实难题，比如怎么让小区公园里的池塘水变得更清澈。你们一起**开脑洞**（kāi nǎodòng），讨论方案，搭建模型，一遍遍地试验。有时候会失败，但你们不放弃，继续钻研、改进。终于，你们做的智能浮岛真的被放进了池塘里，它开始工作，帮助小鱼和别的生物，让水变得干净！你亲眼看到**自己的想法**和努力让世界变好了一点点，心里别提多自豪了！

这些小小**发明家**告诉我们，想做贡献，年龄可不是问题！如果你也能用科学或技术解决学校、家里或者小区里的一个问题，你会发明什么？你想创造一个什么样的神奇东西呢？
