News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

**Amazing Monarch Butterfly Migration Across Three Continents!**

Scientists have discovered something incredible about monarch butterflies! These beautiful orange and black insects have now been spotted traveling across North America, Europe, and even parts of Asia. Imagine you're standing in a field in Mexico, watching thousands of monarch butterflies fill the sky like floating flowers! This migration journey is so long that it would take you 2,345 basketball courts lined up end to end to match the distance they fly.

Researchers have been amazed to see monarch butterflies adapt to different climates and food sources across these three continents. They have noticed that the butterflies have changed their eating habits and now enjoy various types of milkweed plants in different regions. If you could follow monarch butterflies on their journey, which continent would you most like to visit with them?

**Young Scientists Help Build New Rocket!**

Exciting news from the world of space exploration! CAS Space (Chinese Academy of Sciences Space) has developed a new rocket called Kinetica 2, and it's scheduled to fly for the first time before the end of this year. What makes this story special is that a group of students aged 12-14 have participated in building some components for this rocket. Imagine you're sitting in the control room, watching the big screen as the countdown reaches zero and the rocket roars into space!

The rocket is as tall as a 15-story building and can carry satellites weighing as much as 5 elephants into orbit. The students helped design small parts that will measure temperature and pressure during the flight. Their contributions have been praised by engineers at CAS Space. Would you like to help build rockets when you grow up? What part of a rocket would you most want to design?

**Beijing Tech Show Features Amazing Robots!**

The 2025 Inclusive Conference was held in Shanghai's Huangpu World Expo Park on September 11th, showcasing how artificial intelligence is used in different industries and daily life. At the exhibition, visitors could see robots that dance, cook, and even play musical instruments. Picture yourself walking through a hall where robots greet you by name and can answer all your questions about technology!

One of the most popular exhibits was a robot that could paint pictures based on children's drawings. The robot uses special cameras to see the artwork and then creates its own version on a digital screen. Children at the event loved watching their simple drawings transform into colorful digital art. If you could design a robot to help with something in your daily life, what would it do? Homework? Cleaning? Or maybe something more creative?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索... 砰！啪！哇！

**横跨三大洲的奇妙帝王蝶迁徙！**

科学家们发现了关于帝王蝶的令人难以置信的事情！这些美丽的黑橙色昆虫现在被发现穿越北美、欧洲，甚至亚洲部分地区。想象一下，你正站在墨西哥的一片田野中，看着成千上万只帝王蝴蝶像漂浮的花朵一样布满天空！这段迁徙旅程如此之长，相当于2,345个篮球场首尾相连才能匹配它们飞行的距离。

研究人员惊讶地发现帝王蝶能够适应这三个大洲的不同气候和食物来源。他们注意到这些蝴蝶已经改变了它们的饮食习惯，现在享受不同地区各种类型的马利筋植物。如果你能跟随帝王蝶踏上一段旅程，你最想和它们一起造访哪个大洲呢？

**年轻科学家助力建造新火箭！**

来自太空探索领域的令人兴奋的消息！中国科学院空间公司（CAS Space）研发了一款名为Kinetica 2的新火箭，并计划在今年年底前进行首次飞行。这个故事特别之处在于，一群12-14岁的学生参与了这款火箭一些组件的制造。想象一下，你正坐在控制室里，看着大屏幕上的倒计时归零，火箭轰鸣着冲向太空！

这枚火箭有15层楼那么高，能将重达5头大象的卫星送入轨道。这些学生帮助设计了一些将在飞行中测量温度和压力的小部件。他们CAS空间的工程师们对学生们的贡献赞不绝口。你长大后想帮助建造火箭吗？你最想设计火箭的哪个部分？

**北京科技展展示神奇机器人！**

2025年包容性大会于9月11日在上海黄浦世界博览会公园举行，展示了人工智能如何在各行业和日常生活中应用。在展览上，参观者可以看到会跳舞、做饭甚至演奏乐器的机器人。想象你穿过一个大厅，那里的机器人会叫出你的名字，还能回答你关于技术的所有问题！

最受欢迎的展品之一是一个能够根据儿童绘画创作的机器人。这个机器人使用特殊摄像头看到艺术品，然后在数字屏幕上创作出它自己的版本。活动中，孩子们喜欢看着他们的简单绘画转化为色彩斑斓的数字艺术。如果你能设计一个机器人来帮助你日常生活中的某些事情，你会让它做什么？作业？打扫卫生？或者更有创意的事情？
