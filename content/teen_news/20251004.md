News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever seen a light show in the sky that crosses continents? Scientists have discovered something amazing! A rare natural phenomenon has been observed in both North America and Europe. Scientists have seen colorful auroras (极光/corora borealis) appearing simultaneously in both Canada and Finland! This special light display has stretched across more than 7,000 kilometers, which is about the same distance as flying from Beijing to Istanbul and back again! Imagine you're standing in a snowy field at night, looking up as green and purple lights dance above you like magic ribbons in the sky. Scientists have told us that this happens when tiny particles from the sun hit Earth's atmosphere. Have you ever wondered what causes these beautiful patterns in the night sky? What would you do if you could see such an amazing light show?

In our second story, we're excited to share how kids like you are joining space adventures! NASA (美国国家航空航天局/National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has invited students from twelve countries to join their new "Young Stars Program." A team of ten-year-olds from Brazil and Japan have already designed a small robot that will help clean up space junk (垃圾/trash) around Earth. These young scientists have built a robot that can move through space and collect dangerous pieces from old satellites. The robot is only 30 centimeters tall, but it's as powerful as 1000 magnets put together! Imagine floating in space beside this tiny robot as it works to make space safer for future astronauts. The children's invention will be sent into space next year. What would you create if you had the chance to send something to space?

Our final story brings us to the wonderful world of art and creativity! Schools around the world have started a new project called "Global Art Friends," where students create artwork and share it with children in other countries. Last month, a group of elementary students from Africa painted pictures of wild animals that were sent to schools in Asia. In return, Asian students created beautiful paper cuttings showing their local festivals. This cultural exchange (交流/exchange) has helped over 5,000 students learn about different countries and traditions. The artwork is so amazing that it now covers an area equal to 20 basketball courts! Imagine walking through a huge gallery filled with colorful paintings and crafts made by children from every corner of the world. Why don't you try creating something today that represents your hometown? What special place or story from your area would you want to share with a friend in another country?

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! Keep exploring the wonderful world around you!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要飞驰探索...砰！噗！哇！

你曾经看过横跨几大洲的天空灯光秀吗？科学家们发现了一个超乎寻常的自然奇观！一种罕见的天文现象同时在北美和欧洲被观测到。科学家们看到绚丽的极光同时在加拿大和芬兰出现！这次特殊的光展横跨了7000多公里，相当于从北京飞到伊斯坦布尔再返回的距离！想象一下，你正站在夜晚雪白的田野中，仰望天空，看着绿色和紫色的光带像魔法丝带一样在你头顶舞动。科学家告诉我们，这种现象是当太阳释放的微小粒子撞击地球大气层时发生的。你是否曾经想过这些美丽的夜空图案是如何形成的？如果能看到如此惊人的光秀，你会怎么做？

在我们的第二个故事中，我们兴奋地向大家分享像你们这样的孩子们是如何加入太空探险的！NASA（美国国家航空航天局）邀请了来自十二个国家的学生加入他们的"少年之星计划"。一群来自巴西和日本的十岁孩子们已经设计了一个小型机器人，用来清理地球周围的太空垃圾。这些年轻的科学家们发明了一个可以在太空中移动并收集老旧卫星危险碎片的机器人。这个机器人只有30厘米高，但它的磁力相当于1000块磁铁组合在一起！想象一下，漂浮在太空中，与这个小小的机器人并肩工作，让它为未来的宇航员创造更安全的太空环境。孩子们的发明将在明年被送入太空。如果你有机会向太空发送东西，你会创造什么呢？

我们的最后一个故事把我们带到了奇妙的艺术和创意世界！世界各地的学校开展了一个名为"全球艺术伙伴"的新项目，学生们创作艺术作品并与来自其他国家的孩子分享。上个月，一组非洲小学生绘制了野生动物画作，寄送到了亚洲的学校。作为回礼，亚洲学生创作了展示当地节日美景的精美剪纸。这种文化交流已经帮助超过5000名学生了解不同国家的传统。这些艺术品太棒了，它们现在所覆盖的面积相当于20个篮球场！想象一下，漫步在一个巨大的画廊里，里面挂满了来自世界各地的孩子们创作的色彩缤纷的绘画和手工艺品。为何不今天尝试创作一些能代表你家乡的作品呢？你想要与外国朋友分享你所在地区的什么特别的地方或故事？

这就是今天的新闻探索时间全部内容！继续探索你周围的精彩世界吧！
