News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索... Bang! Pop! Wow!

### African Giant Snails Invade Shenzhen!

Scientists have discovered that African giant snails have spread across Shenzhen, covering an area equivalent to 500 football fields! These snails, which originally come from Africa, have traveled thousands of kilometers to reach Asia. Imagine you are walking in a Shenzhen park at night, with only your flashlight to guide you. Suddenly, you see hundreds of huge snails, each as big as your hand, slowly moving across the path! These snails have become a big problem because they eat local plants and can damage (spoil/ruin) the environment. Local people have formed special "snail hunter" teams to control their population. One team member told us, "I have collected over 1,000 snails in just one night!" These snails can carry parasites (寄生虫/parasitic worms) that might make people sick, so experts warn everyone not to touch them. If you found these giant snails in your neighborhood, what would you do to help protect the local environment?

### High-Tech Welcome at Universities!

Universities across China have welcomed new students with amazing technology shows. At Shenzhen Polytechnic University, visitors have seen robots dancing and drones flying in formation. The event has attracted thousands of young students and their families. Imagine you are standing in the middle of a bright exhibition hall, surrounded by buzzing robots and whirring drones! Students from the Computer Science department have created special programs that allow these machines to perform incredible (amazing/wonderful) tricks. One twelve-year-old visitor, Xiao Ming, said, "I've never seen anything like this! I want to study robotics when I grow up!" The university has also set up hands-on experience zones where young visitors can try controlling small robots themselves. This event has inspired many teenagers to become interested in science and technology. What kind of robot would you like to create if you had the chance?

### The Art of Making Perfect Tea!

Did you know that the temperature of water can change how your tea tastes? Scientists have found that different teas need different water temperatures to taste best. Imagine you are in a traditional Chinese tea house, watching a tea master carefully pour water at just the right temperature over the tea leaves! Green tea tastes best when the water is around 75-80°C, while black tea needs boiling water at 100°C. When water is too hot, it releases too much caffeine (咖啡因/coffee substance) from the tea leaves, making the tea bitter. When the water is not hot enough, the tea might not release enough flavor. Tea experts have developed special techniques to tell the water temperature without using a thermometer. Some listen for the sound of bubbles, while others watch the size of the bubbles in the water. Making perfect tea is both a science and an art! Would you like to try making tea using these traditional methods?

### 非洲大蜗牛入侵深圳！

科学家们发现，非洲大蜗牛已经蔓延到深圳各地，覆盖面积相当于500个足球场那么大！这些蜗牛原本来自非洲，却跋涉数千公里来到了亚洲。想象一下，你正夜晚走在深圳的公园里，只有手电筒为你照亮前路。突然，你看到数百只像你手掌一样巨大的蜗牛，正在小路上缓慢爬行！这些蜗牛已经成为一个大问题，因为它们吃本地植物，还会破坏环境。当地居民组成了特别的"蜗牛猎人"队伍来控制它们的数量。一位队员告诉我们："我仅一晚上就捕捉了1000多只蜗牛！"这些蜗牛可能携带寄生虫，会让人生病，所以专家警告大家不要触碰它们。简直不要太厉害！如果你在自家附近发现这些巨型蜗牛，你会怎么做来帮助保护当地环境呢？

### 高校高科技迎新活动！

全国各地的大学都用令人惊叹的科技展示来欢迎新生。在深圳职业技术大学，游客们看到了机器人跳舞和无人机编队飞行。这个活动吸引了成千上万的学生和家长。想象一下，你站在一个明亮的展览厅中央，周围是嗡嗡作响的机器人和呼呼飞旋的无人机！计算机系的学生们创造了特殊程序，让这些机器表演令人难以置信的绝技。一位十二岁的参观者小明说："我从来没见过这样的场面！我长大后想学习机器人技术！"大学还设立了动手体验区，让年轻参观者可以亲自尝试控制小型机器人。这个活动激发了许多青少年对科学技术的兴趣。简直不要太酷！如果你有机会，你想创造什么样的机器人呢？

### 泡出完美茶水的艺术！

你知道吗，水温会改变茶的味道吗？科学家们发现，不同的茶需要不同的水温才能达到最佳口感。想象一下，你正坐在一家传统茶馆里，看着茶艺师小心翼翼地将温度恰到好处的水倒在茶叶上！绿茶在75-80°C的水温下味道最佳，而红茶则需要100°C的沸水。当水温太高时，会从茶叶中释放出过多的咖啡因，使茶变得苦涩。当水温不够高时，茶可能无法释放足够的香味。茶艺专家们已经发展出特殊技巧来判断水温，而不使用温度计。有些人通过聆听气泡的声音，而另一些人则观察水中气泡的大小。泡出完美的茶既是一门科学，也是一门艺术！简直不要太神奇！你想尝试用这些传统方法来泡茶吗？
