**Host:** News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore a green miracle, the heroes behind it, and the cool technology that protects it! Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello everyone and welcome to our weekly news report. Have you ever seen a place completely change its face? I mean, from a totally empty and barren land to a beautiful, green forest. Today, we have an amazing story about a place called the Saihanba Mechanized Forest Farm, which is in China’s Hebei (a northern province) province. This story shows us how people and nature have worked together for over 60 years.

Let's travel back in time. Imagine standing in Saihanba six decades ago. You feel a strong, chilly wind blowing sand into your face. You look around and see almost nothing but sandy lands and rocky hills. It was a barren expanse, a place where it was very difficult for plants to grow. But now, let's open our eyes in the present day. You hear birds singing and feel the fresh, clean air. You see a vast sea of trees! This incredible place is now home to 500 million trees. It’s a number so big, it’s hard to picture. So let's try this: if you placed all those trees one meter apart in a single line, that line would go around the Earth's equator 12 times! That's a truly brilliant, big achievement, isn't it? This amazing transformation has not happened by magic. It is the result of hard work by three generations of foresters.

Now, let's talk about the challenges these forest heroes have faced. By 2012, they had already planted trees on all the suitable land. The only places left were the really difficult ones: the rocky slopes and sandy areas. We are talking about 7,067 hectares of tough terrain. To help you visualize that, it's like trying to plant a forest on nearly 10,000 football fields made of rock! The manager of the farm, Yu Shitao, explained that on slopes steeper than 40 degrees, big machines couldn't be used. Can you picture a hill so steep it feels like you are almost climbing a wall? On these slopes so steep, the brave foresters had to do everything by hand. They had to dig out the rocks one by one. They relied on manual labor or used livestock, like horses or mules, to carry the soil and baby trees up the hills. It must have been such tiring work, day after day. Their effort offers a vivid example of how people and nature can protect and sustain one another. If you were one of those foresters, what would you feel seeing a tiny tree finally take root on a rock you helped clear?

After successfully planting the trees, a new challenge appeared. At first, most of the trees were of a single species. This is called a monoculture plantation. While it looks neat, it’s not very strong. A forest with only one type of tree is more likely to get sick from pests or diseases. To make the forest healthier and improve its `resilience` (strength/toughness), the foresters started to introduce a mix of different tree species. This has gradually transformed the area into a more diverse and stronger forest.

To protect this precious green treasure, the foresters are now using some very advanced technologies. It's like they have become high-tech forest guardians! Li Shuang, who is in charge of pest control, said that they have established a remote monitoring and command system. Imagine a huge control room with big screens. This system uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data to `oversee` (supervise/watch) the entire forest. It can spot any sign of pests or diseases very early. Because of this `meticulous` (careful/detailed) management, the number of harmful bugs has remained below 0.3 percent. That's incredibly low!

But pests are not the only danger. Fire is also a huge threat to any forest. Saihanba has implemented a `comprehensive` (complete/full) early-warning system that covers 100 percent of the area. They are `integrating` (combining/uniting) all kinds of amazing tools: satellites high up in space, helicopters and drones flying in the sky, special fire-detection radar, video cameras, and of course, people on the ground who patrol and watch from lookout towers. By `safeguarding` (protecting/defending) the forest in this way, they make sure any fire can be found and stopped immediately.

The story of Saihanba is more than just about planting trees. It’s a powerful lesson. It shows how decades of effort can turn a desert into an oasis. And projects like this have a global impact. China has made the largest contribution to the world's new green areas in the last two decades, accounting for about one-fourth of the global increase. The green miracle of Saihanba is an inspiration for all of us. What do you think is the most important lesson we can learn from the three generations of Saihanba foresters?

**主持人：** News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索一个绿色的奇迹、奇迹背后的英雄，还有保护它的超酷科技！Bang! Pop! Wow!

大家好，欢迎收听我们的每周新闻快报。你见过一个地方彻底改头换面吗？我的意思是，从一片光秃秃的不毛之地，变成一片美丽、绿色的森林。今天，我们就要讲述一个超棒的故事，故事的主角是位于中国河北省（中国北部的一个省份）的塞罕坝（Sāihǎnbà）机械化林场。这个故事向我们展示了在过去60多年里，人类和自然是如何携手合作的。

让我们穿越回过去。想象一下，六十年前你正站在塞罕坝。你感觉到一阵强劲的冷风，把沙子吹到你的脸上。你环顾四周，除了沙地和石头山，几乎什么也看不见。那是一片荒凉的土地，植物很难在这里生长。但是现在，让我们在今天睁开双眼。你听到了鸟儿的歌唱，感受到了清新、干净的空气。你看到了一片广阔的树海！这个不可思议的地方现在拥有5亿棵树。这个数字太大了，简直没法想象。那我们来试试这样想：如果你把所有这些树隔开一米排成一条直线，这条线可以绕地球赤道12圈！这真是一个了不起的伟大成就，对吧？这个惊人的转变可不是魔法变出来的。这是三代林场工人辛勤劳动的结果。

现在，我们来聊聊这些森林英雄们曾经面对的挑战。到2012年，他们已经在所有适合的土地上都种上了树。剩下没种的，都是些特别难啃的“硬骨头”：到处是石头的山坡和沙地。我们说的是7067公顷的困难地形。为了让你有个概念，这差不多相当于在将近10000个由岩石构成的足球场上种树！林场的管理者于士涛解释说，在超过40度的陡坡上，大型机械根本上不去。你能想象一座山坡陡峭到感觉像在爬墙吗？在这些陡峭的山坡上，勇敢的工人们只能全靠双手。他们必须一块一块地挖出石头。他们依靠人力，或者用牲畜，比如马或骡子，把泥土和树苗运上山。日复一日，这肯定是超级累人的工作。他们的努力就像现实版的“愚公移山”，生动地展示了人与自然如何相互守护、共同成长。如果你是那些工人中的一员，当你看到一棵小树终于在你亲手清理的石头地上扎根时，你会有什么感觉？

成功种下树木后，新的挑战又出现了。一开始，林场里大部分都是同一种树。这被称为“单一纯林”。虽然看起来很整齐，但它并不强壮。只有一种树木的森林，更容易受到害虫或疾病的攻击。为了让森林更健康、更有抵抗力，工人们开始引进不同种类的树木。这逐渐将这里从单一的种植林，变成了一个物种更多样、更强大的森林。

为了保护这片珍贵的绿色宝藏，现在的护林员们正在使用一些非常先进的技术。他们简直就像是高科技的森林守护者！负责病虫害防治的李双说，他们建立了一套远程监控指挥系统。想象一个有许多大屏幕的巨大控制室。这套系统利用人工智能（AI）和大数据来监测整片森林。它能很早地发现任何害虫或疾病的迹象。由于这种一丝不苟的管理，有害生物的发生率一直保持在0.3%以下。这个比例低得惊人！

但害虫不是唯一的危险。火灾对任何森林来说都是一个巨大的威胁。塞罕坝实施了一套覆盖率100%的全方位预警监测系统。他们把各种神奇的工具结合在一起：天上的卫星、空中的直升机和无人机、特殊的火灾探测雷达、视频监控，当然还有地面上巡逻和从瞭（liào）望塔上观察的工作人员。通过这种方式守护森林，他们能确保任何火情都能被立刻发现并被阻止。简直不要太厉害！

塞罕坝的故事不仅仅是种树。它给我们上了强有力的一课，告诉我们几十年的努力真的可以把沙漠变成绿洲。而且，像这样的项目还具有全球性的影响力。在过去二十年里，中国为世界新增的绿化面积做出了最大贡献，约占全球增量的四分之一。塞罕坝的绿色奇迹，对我们所有人都是一种鼓舞。你认为我们可以从三代塞罕坝人身上学到的最重要的一课是什么？
