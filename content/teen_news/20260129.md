## English Version

**News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore the world of giant pandas, space travel dreams, and clever robot inventors!**

### Story 1: Japan's Last Two Giant Pandas Return Home to China

Have you ever said goodbye to a dear friend? This week, something very special happened at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, Japan. The zoo's last two giant pandas, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, said goodbye to their Japanese fans and flew back home to China!

These twin pandas were born in Japan in 2021, but their parents came from China. In China, all giant pandas belong to the country, so when pandas are born overseas, they eventually need to return home.

The farewell was incredibly touching. Thousands of Japanese visitors lined up for hours in the cold winter weather just to catch one last glimpse of the fluffy black-and-white bears. Some people even cried!

"I've visited them every month since they were babies," said one Japanese grandmother. "It feels like saying goodbye to family."

The pandas traveled in special comfortable containers on a direct flight to Chengdu, where they will live at the famous Panda Base. Scientists hope they will help increase the panda population.

**Did you know?** There are fewer than 2,000 giant pandas left in the wild. Every panda is precious!

### Story 2: China Opens School for Space Travel - Yes, Really!

Imagine going to a school where your lessons include planning trips to Mars, building spacecraft, and figuring out how humans could live among the stars. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, not anymore!

The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences just opened the world's first "Interstellar Travel Academy" on January 28th. The school's mission is to train young scientists who will help humanity travel beyond our solar system one day.

Here's something cool: the famous film director Guo Fan, who made the blockbuster movie "The Wandering Earth," attended the opening ceremony. He wrote just seven Chinese characters on social media after the event: "Dreams eventually become reality."

The academy will focus on three big questions:
1. How can we travel faster than we do now?
2. How can humans survive in space for very long journeys?
3. What do we need to build a civilization among the stars?

Students at this new academy will study everything from rocket science to biology to artificial intelligence. The first class has already started!

**Think about it:** If you could design a spaceship for a 100-year journey to another star, what would you include?

### Story 3: College Students Build Amazing "Light-Off Robot" That Goes Viral

Have you ever been too tired to get out of bed just to turn off the light? Some creative university students in China solved this problem in the most entertaining way possible!

A video of their invention went viral on Chinese social media this week. It shows a small robot that can shoot a tiny ball to hit the light switch from across the room. When the robot successfully turns off the light, the room goes dark - and the internet goes wild!

Behind this fun invention is a serious robotics team at a Chinese university. These students spend their weekends building robots for competitions, not just convenience gadgets.

"We started the 'light-off robot' as a joke," explained one team member. "But building it taught us so much about sensors, motors, and programming. Making learning fun is the best way to learn!"

The team has won multiple national robotics competitions. They design robots that can do everything from playing basketball to navigating obstacle courses.

Their message to young students: "Don't be afraid to play with technology. Every invention starts with curiosity and fun!"

**Challenge for you:** What simple task would you want a robot to help you with? Can you draw a design for it?

**新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索大熊猫的世界、太空旅行梦想，还有聪明的机器人发明家！**

### 故事一：日本最后两只大熊猫回到中国

你有没有和好朋友告别过？这周，东京上野动物园发生了一件非常特别的事。动物园里最后两只大熊猫——晓晓和蕾蕾，向日本的粉丝们告别，飞回了中国老家！

这对双胞胎熊猫2021年在日本出生，但它们的父母来自中国。在中国，所有大熊猫都属于国家，所以在海外出生的熊猫最终都要回家。

告别的场面非常感人。成千上万的日本游客在寒冷的冬天排队好几个小时，就为了最后看一眼这两只毛茸茸的黑白大熊。有些人甚至哭了！

"从它们还是小宝宝的时候，我每个月都来看它们，"一位日本老奶奶说，"感觉就像在和家人告别。"

大熊猫们坐在特制的舒适容器里，乘坐直飞航班来到了成都，它们将在著名的大熊猫基地生活。科学家们希望它们能帮助增加熊猫的数量。

**你知道吗？** 野外只剩下不到2000只大熊猫了。每一只熊猫都非常珍贵！

### 故事二：中国开设星际航行学院——这是真的！

想象一下，去一所学校上课，课程内容包括计划火星之旅、建造宇宙飞船、研究人类如何在星际间生活。听起来像科幻小说，对吧？现在，这已经不是幻想了！

中国科学院大学在1月28日正式成立了全球首个"星际航行学院"。这所学院的使命是培养年轻的科学家，帮助人类有一天能够飞出太阳系。

有个很酷的事：拍摄了科幻大片《流浪地球》的著名导演郭帆也参加了开幕式。活动结束后，他在社交媒体上只写了七个字："梦想终将成为现实。"

学院将重点研究三个大问题：
1. 我们怎样才能比现在飞得更快？
2. 人类如何在漫长的太空旅行中生存？
3. 我们需要什么才能在星际间建立文明？

这所新学院的学生将学习从火箭科学到生物学再到人工智能的各种知识。第一届学生已经开始上课了！

**想一想：** 如果你要设计一艘进行100年星际旅行的宇宙飞船，你会在里面放些什么？

### 故事三：大学生造出神奇"关灯神器"爆红网络

你有没有累得不想起床，就为了关个灯？中国的一些有创意的大学生用最有趣的方式解决了这个问题！

他们发明的视频这周在中国社交媒体上火了。视频里展示了一个小机器人，可以射出一个小球，隔着房间打中灯的开关。当机器人成功关灯时，房间变黑了——网友们沸腾了！

这个有趣的发明背后是一支认真的大学机器人战队。这些学生利用周末时间造机器人参加比赛，而不只是做方便生活的小玩意。

"我们一开始做'关灯机器人'只是开玩笑，"一位队员解释说，"但制作它让我们学到了很多关于传感器、电机和编程的知识。让学习变得有趣是最好的学习方式！"

这支队伍已经赢得了多项全国机器人竞赛。他们设计的机器人能做各种事情，从打篮球到穿越障碍赛道。

他们给年轻学生的寄语是："不要害怕玩科技。每一项发明都始于好奇心和乐趣！"

**挑战你：** 你希望机器人帮你做什么简单的事？你能画出它的设计图吗？
