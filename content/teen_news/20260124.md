## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore three amazing stories from around the world - from the icy waters of Antarctica to high-tech robot workshops, and finally to traditional Chinese art studios. Let's dive in!

### Story 1: The Penguin's Unexpected Gift

Imagine you're a penguin swimming in the cold Antarctic waters. Suddenly, you see a large leopard seal approaching. What would you do? Run away? Not if you're a special penguin!

Scientists have discovered something fascinating about leopard seals in Antarctica. These large predators, which can grow up to 3.5 meters long, usually hunt penguins and other seals. But sometimes, they do something completely unexpected - they "give" penguins as gifts!

Here's how it works: A leopard seal catches a penguin but doesn't eat it immediately. Instead, it gently pushes the penguin toward a group of human divers or scientists nearby. The seal seems to be showing off its catch, almost like saying, "Look what I found!"

This behavior has been observed multiple times. One diver recounted how a leopard seal repeatedly brought live penguins to her, gently nudging them toward her. The penguins were confused but unharmed!

Scientists have several theories about why this happens:
- The seal might be trying to play or interact with humans
- It could be showing hunting skills as a form of communication
- Perhaps the seal is curious about these strange visitors in its territory

Whatever the reason, this reminds us that animals can have complex behaviors that we don't always understand. The Antarctic, with its vast expanses of ice and snow, is home to many such mysteries waiting to be discovered.

**Think about it:** If you could communicate with any animal, what would you ask them? What do you think they would tell you about their world?

### Story 2: The "Light Switch Wizard" and the Robot Team

In a university dormitory in China, there's a special team of students who built something amazing - a robot that can turn off lights automatically! Let's call it the "Light Switch Wizard."

This all started when students noticed that many people forget to turn off lights when leaving the room. This wastes electricity and harms the environment. So, a group of engineering students decided to solve this problem using technology.

They formed a robot team and spent months designing and building their invention. Here's what their robot can do:
- It uses sensors to detect when people leave a room
- It can automatically flip light switches on and off
- It connects to a smartphone app, so users can control it remotely
- It even learns people's habits to save more energy

The team faced many challenges. They had to learn about electronics, programming, and mechanical design. They worked late nights, tested their robot hundreds of times, and fixed countless problems. But they never gave up!

Their hard work paid off. The "Light Switch Wizard" became popular on campus, and many students wanted one for their rooms. The team even won awards at innovation competitions.

What makes this story special is that it shows how young people can use technology to solve real-world problems. These students didn't just dream about making a difference - they actually built something that helps people and protects the environment.

**Imagine this:** If you could build a robot to help with one daily problem, what would it do? Would it clean your room? Help with homework? Maybe water your plants? The possibilities are endless!

### Story 3: Clay Art: Ancient Skills Meet Young Hands

In a small community in Qingdao, Shandong Province, something wonderful is happening. Children as young as five years old are learning the ancient art of clay sculpture, called "Nisu" in Chinese.

The activity is part of a program called "Intangible Cultural Heritage Welcomes Spring." During the winter holidays, local children gather at a workshop to learn from master craftsmen who have practiced this art for decades.

Clay sculpture is one of China's traditional arts. Artists use their hands to shape soft clay into beautiful figures - animals, flowers, legendary creatures, and scenes from daily life. After shaping, the clay is dried and fired in a kiln to become permanent pottery.

At this workshop, children sit at small tables, each with a ball of clay in front of them. The master craftsmen guide them step by step:
1. First, they learn how to warm the clay in their hands
2. Then they practice basic shapes - balls, coils, and flat pieces
3. Finally, they create their own unique artwork

One six-year-old girl made a tiny clay rabbit with long ears. A boy crafted a small dragon with detailed scales. The children were focused and excited, their hands moving carefully as they brought their imagination to life.

This program is about more than just making toys. It's about:
- Connecting young people with traditional culture
- Teaching patience and focus
- Developing creativity and artistic skills
- Passing down knowledge from one generation to the next

When you think about it, this is how culture survives - not in museums, but in the hands of children who keep learning and creating.

**Reflect on this:** What traditional art or craft from your culture would you like to learn? How would you teach it to someone younger than you?

### 故事一：企鹅的"礼物"

想象一下，你是一只企鹅，在寒冷的南极水域游泳。突然，你看到一只巨大的豹海豹向你游来。你会怎么做？逃跑吗？但如果有些企鹅并不逃跑呢？

科学家在南极发现了一件令人惊讶的事情。这些长达3.5米的捕食者通常会捕食企鹅和其他海豹，但有时它们会做一些完全意想不到的事情——把企鹅当作"礼物"送给人类！

事情是这样的：豹海豹抓住一只企鹅后，并不立刻吃掉它，而是轻轻地把企鹅推向附近的潜水员或科学家。海豹似乎在炫耀它的猎物，就像在说："看，我找到了什么！"

这种行为已经被观察到多次。一位潜水员回忆说，一只豹海豹反复把活企鹅带给她，轻轻地推向她。企鹅们虽然困惑，但都没有受伤！

科学家对这种行为有几种猜测：
- 海豹可能想和人类玩耍或互动
- 它可能在展示狩猎技巧，作为一种交流方式
- 也许海豹对出现在它领地的这些奇怪访客感到好奇

无论原因是什么，这提醒我们动物可能有我们不完全理解的复杂行为。南极这片冰雪覆盖的广阔大陆，还有许多等待发现的谜题。

**想一想：**如果你能和任何动物交流，你会问它什么？你觉得它会告诉你关于它世界的哪些事情？

### 故事二："关灯神器"和机器人战队

在中国的一所大学宿舍里，有一群特殊的学生，他们制造了一件惊人的发明——一个可以自动关灯的机器人！我们叫它"关灯神器"吧。

这一切始于学生们注意到很多人离开房间时会忘记关灯。这不仅浪费电，还会对环境造成伤害。于是，一群工程系的学生决定用技术来解决这个问题。

他们组建了一个机器人战队，花了几个月的时间设计和制造这个发明。他们的机器人可以：
- 使用传感器检测人们何时离开房间
- 自动开关电灯
- 连接手机应用，用户可以远程控制
- 甚至能学习人们的习惯来节省更多能源

这个团队遇到了很多挑战。他们必须学习电子学、编程和机械设计。他们加班到深夜，测试了几百次，修复了无数问题。但他们从未放弃！

他们的努力得到了回报。"关灯神器"在校园里很受欢迎，很多学生都想在自己的房间放一个。这个团队还在创新比赛中获奖了。

这个故事特别之处在于，它展示了年轻人如何用技术解决现实问题。这些学生不只是梦想改变世界——他们真的制造了能帮助人们、保护环境的东西。

**想象一下：**如果你能制造一个机器人来解决日常生活中的一个问题，它会做什么？帮你打扫房间？辅导作业？还是浇花？可能性是无限的！

### 故事三：泥塑艺术：古老技艺遇上年轻双手

在山东省青岛市的一个小社区里，正在发生一件美好的事情。年仅五岁的孩子们正在学习古老的泥塑艺术，在中国被称为"泥塑"。

这项活动是"非遗迎春"项目的一部分。寒假期间，当地孩子们聚集在一个工作坊里，向有几十年经验的大师级工匠学习。

泥塑是中国传统艺术之一。艺术家们用双手把柔软的泥土塑造成美丽的形象——动物、花朵、传说中的生物和日常生活的场景。塑造完成后，泥土会被晾干并在窑中烧制，成为永久的陶器。

在这个工作坊里，孩子们围坐在小桌子前，每个人面前都有一团泥土。大师级工匠们一步步指导他们：
1. 首先，他们学习如何在手中温暖泥土
2. 然后练习基本形状——圆球、长条和平面
3. 最后，他们创作自己独特的艺术品

一个六岁的小女孩做了一只长耳朵的小兔子。一个男孩制作了一条有细致鳞片的小龙。孩子们专注而兴奋，他们的双手小心翼翼地移动，把想象力变成了现实。

这个项目不仅仅是制作玩具，它还关于：
- 让年轻人与传统文化建立联系
- 教授耐心和专注力
- 培养创造力和艺术技能
- 将知识从一代传给下一代

想一想，文化就是这样传承的——不是在博物馆里，而是在不断学习和创造的孩子们手中。

**反思一下：**你想学习本文化中的哪种传统艺术或手工艺？你会如何把它教给你更小的人？
