News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello everyone, and welcome to another exciting edition of News Discovery Time! Your favourite young reporter is here, ready to share some amazing stories from around our incredible planet! Let's dive right in!

First up, we're feeling the heat... literally! Parts of Southern Europe have been experiencing a *scorching* summer heatwave! Can you believe temperatures have *gone* up to over 40 degrees Celsius? That's hotter than most hot tubs! This fiery heat isn't just affecting one place; countries like Italy, Greece, France, Spain, and Portugal have all been feeling the *fizzing* furnace. The air causing this heatwave has even travelled from North Africa! So, people in places across *two* continents, Europe and Africa, are connecting through this hot, hot air!

Scientists have looked at this heatwave, and they've said that hot spells like this, with three super-hot days in a row, are now about 10 times more likely to happen than they were a long, long time ago. This is because of something called climate change. Authorities (officials/people in charge) in these countries *have been busy* issuing warnings and telling people how to stay safe. They have advised everyone, especially vulnerable (weak/easily hurt) people like young children and the elderly, to stay inside during the hottest parts of the day.

**Imagine standing on a sunny street in Rome or Madrid.** The air feels thick and warm, like stepping into a sauna! You can see people seeking shade and perhaps enjoying more cold drinks than usual. It's a real challenge for everyone to stay cool and comfortable. This heat has also unfortunately contributed to wildfires in some areas, like near Athens in Greece, where dry conditions make fires spread quickly.

This situation shows us how connected our world is, even through the weather! It also reminds us how important it is to take care of our planet. **What would *you* do to stay cool and safe if it was over 40 degrees outside?** Would you invent a giant ice cream machine for your town? Hmm!

Okay, switching gears completely! Our next story takes us all the way to China, where something super cool is happening with students and ancient art! Did you know that students at a university in Jinzhong have been working hard to protect and learn old crafts? They have *turned* their campus into a place where history and art meet!

They have created special workshops and art spaces. How many, you ask? The university has 12 student 'colleges' with over 200 special rooms for activities and a huge art space that covers more than 37,000 square meters! That's like having an art museum the size of fifty large basketball courts right at school! They have even built a giant museum just for "Intangible Cultural Heritage" (Fēi yí / 非物质文化遗产 - traditional skills and knowledge that are passed down, like crafts or music). This museum has welcomed over 11,000 visitors – that's more people than can fill a large concert hall!

Students have been learning amazing skills like *掐丝珐琅* (Qiā sī fà láng), which is like drawing pictures with thin metal wires and then filling them with colourful enamel! They have also tried *麦秆画* (Mài gǎn huà), which is making pictures using tiny pieces of straw. Isn't that creative? These aren't just normal classes; the university has included these heritage lessons as part of their main learning program, even offering course credits for them. New students have joined 'Non-Heritage Art Exploration' classes, and older students *have been sneaking* in because they want to learn too!

**Picture yourself in one of these busy workshops.** You are holding a small tool, carefully bending a thin wire to make a beautiful shape on a metal plate, or perhaps carefully placing tiny, golden pieces of straw to form a pattern. You can *see* the detailed work and *feel* the focus in the room as everyone works on their pieces. It's quiet, but full of creative energy! These students are not just learning skills; they are becoming guardians of amazing traditions that could otherwise disappear. They have *found* ways to keep these old arts alive for future generations.

It's so wonderful to see young people connecting with the past in such a hands-on way. **If you could learn *any* ancient craft or art form, what would it be and why?** Maybe making pottery, or traditional weaving, or even ancient calligraphy?

That's all the news we have time for today! Remember to explore the world around you with curiosity! See you next time on News Discovery Time!

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要探索... 砰！啪！哇！

各位小朋友大家好，欢迎来到超精彩的《新闻探索时间》！你们最爱的小小播报员又来啦，准备好跟大家分享地球上那些不可思议的酷炫故事了吗？咱们赶紧出发！

首先，我们要去感受一下热浪！没错，是那种热到爆炸的热！最近，南欧的一些地方，比如意大利、希腊、法国、西班牙和葡萄牙，正经历着一场超级热的夏日热浪！简直不要太热！你敢相信吗？温度嗖嗖地飙升到了40摄氏度以上！这比你洗澡时泡澡的热水还要烫呢！这股热空气还从非洲那边**飘过来**了！所以你看，欧洲和非洲——**两个大洲**的小伙伴们，因为这股热气流**感受**到了连接！

科学家们已经仔细研究了这次热浪，他们**发现**像这样连续三天都热得不得了的情况，比很久很久以前**可能**要多发生大约10倍呢！这是因为我们说的气候变化**正在**影响着地球。当地的政府部门（就是管理大家生活的人）可忙碌了，他们**一直在**发布高温警告，告诉大家怎么保护自己。他们**建议**所有人都，特别是像我们这样的小朋友和爷爷奶奶们，要在一天中最热的时候乖乖待在屋里。

**想象一下，你正站在罗马或马德里阳光灿烂的街道上。**空气感觉又厚又热，就像走进了一个大蒸箱！你可以**看到**大家都在找阴凉的地方，也许喝的比平时更多的冷饮。大家都在努力保持凉快和舒服。遗憾的是，这种高温天气还**导致**了一些地方发生了山火，比如希腊首都雅典附近，干燥的天气让火苗**跑得**特别快。

这件事告诉我们，我们的世界其实非常相连，连天气**都能**把大家联系起来！这也**提醒**我们，保护我们的地球是多么重要！**如果是你，外面温度超过40度，你会怎么做来让自己凉快又安全呢？**是不是想发明一个巨型冰淇淋机给全镇人降温？哈哈！

好了，话题一下子**转到**另一边！下一个故事带我们**飞**到中国，那里有一些超酷的事情正**发生**在学生们和古老艺术之间！你知道吗？在晋中（Jìn zhōng）的一所大学里，学生们**一直在**努力保护和学习那些老祖宗留下来的手艺！他们**已经**把自己的学校变成了一个历史和艺术**相遇**的地方！

他们**建好**了很多特别的工作坊和艺术空间。有多少呢？这所大学有12个学生书院，里面有200多个房间**专门用来**搞活动，还有一个超级大的艺术空间，面积超过3万7千平方米！这**等于**把一个跟五十个大篮球场一样大的艺术馆**搬到**了学校里！他们甚至**修建**了一个专门给“非物质文化遗产”（Fēi yí / 非物质文化遗产——就是那些像手艺、音乐这样靠人一代代传下来的、摸不到但很珍贵的文化）的博物馆！这个博物馆**已经迎接**了超过1万1千名参观者——这比装满一个大音乐厅的人还多呢！

学生们**学会了**好多棒呆了的手艺，比如**掐丝珐琅**（Qiā sī fà láng），这个手艺就像是用细细的金属丝在金属板上“画画”，再把五颜六色的釉料填进去！他们还**尝试**了**麦秆画**（Mài gǎn huà），这是用小小的麦秆拼出漂亮的图画。是不是很有创意？这些可不是普通的课程哦，学校已经把这些非遗的课程**加入**到了他们的主课里，学好了还**能**拿学分呢！新来的同学们**参加**了“非遗美育初探”的课，就连快毕业的学长学姐们也**一直在偷偷溜进去**听课，因为他们也想学！

**想象一下，你就在一个热热闹闹的工作坊里。**你正拿着一个小工具，小心翼翼地弯折一根细丝，想在金属板上**做出**一个漂亮的形状，或者正仔细地把一小块一小块金色的麦秆**摆好**，组成一个图案。你可以**看见**那些精巧的细节，也**能感受**到房间里大家专注的劲头。虽然安静，但**充满了**创造的能量！这些学生不仅仅是**学到**了技能，他们**正在**成为这些可能会消失的珍贵传统的守护者。他们**已经找到**了方法，让这些老手艺**能够**一直传下去，让未来的我们也能**看到**！

看到这么多年轻人在**动手实践**中连接过去，真是太棒了！**如果让你选一种古代的手艺或艺术形式来学，你想学什么呢？为什么呢？**也许是做陶器，或者传统织布，甚至是古老的书法？

今天的《新闻探索时间》就到这里啦！记住要带着好奇心**去探索**我们身边的世界哦！下次新闻再见！
