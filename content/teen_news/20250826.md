News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever seen butterflies that travel across continents? Scientists have discovered something amazing about the painted lady butterflies. They have found that these tiny insects fly an incredible 9,000 miles every year from Europe to Africa and back! That's like flying around 360 basketball courts placed end to end. Imagine you're standing in a field in the United Kingdom, watching thousands of orange and black butterflies filling the sky. They feel the changing seasons and begin their long journey. Scientists have tracked them using special tags and have seen them cross the Sahara Desert, fly over the Mediterranean Sea, and reach countries like Morocco and Ethiopia. What do you think these butterflies see during their amazing journey?

In our second story, young inventors have made big news in the world of robots! NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has just announced that a team of 12-year-old students has won their annual robotics competition. The clever kids have created a robot that can clean up plastic waste in oceans. Their robot, called "Sea Sweeper," has already collected (removed/gathered) over 500 pounds of plastic from beaches in California and Australia. Imagine you're on a beautiful beach, feeling the warm sand between your toes, when you see a friendly robot moving along the shore, picking up trash and leaving the sand clean. The students have programmed their robot to identify (recognize/spot) different types of plastic and sort them for recycling. They have also designed it to be powered by solar energy, making it eco-friendly. If you could invent a robot to help the environment, what would it do?

Finally, art and music have brought children from different countries together in a wonderful project called "Colors of Friendship." Children from Japan, Brazil, and Canada have been creating beautiful murals (wall paintings) that show their cultures and dreams. They have completed over 50 murals together, each one telling a story about friendship across borders. Imagine you're holding a paintbrush, mixing bright colors, and working with friends from around the world to create something amazing. The project has also inspired a music album where children sing traditional songs from their countries in both their native language and English. The children have learned that art can connect people without words. Would you like to join such a project and share your culture through art?

That's all for today's news! Remember to keep exploring and discovering new things around you. Bye for now!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索... 砰！啪！哇！

你见过能穿越各大洲的蝴蝶吗？科学家们发现了一些关于小红蛱蝶的惊人事情。他们发现这些小小的昆虫每年能飞行9000英里，从欧洲飞到非洲再飞回来！这相当于360个篮球场首尾相连的长度。想象一下，你站在英国的一片田野上，看到成千上万只橙黑相间的蝴蝶布满天空。它们感受到季节的变化，开始了漫长的旅程。科学家们使用特殊标签追踪它们，看到它们穿越撒哈拉沙漠，飞越地中海，到达摩洛哥和埃塞俄比亚等国家。你觉得这些神奇的蝴蝶在旅途中看到了什么？

第二条新闻中，年轻发明家们在机器人领域创造了大新闻！美国太空总署（NASA）刚刚宣布，一支12岁学生团队赢得了他们年度机器人比赛。这些聪明的孩子们创造了一个能够清理海洋塑料垃圾的机器人。他们的机器人叫"海洋清扫者"，已经从加利福尼亚和澳大利亚的海滩收集了500多磅塑料。想象一下，你站在美丽的海滩上，感受脚趾间温暖的沙子，这时你看到一个友好的机器人在岸边移动，捡起垃圾，留下干净的沙滩。学生们给机器人编程，让它能够识别不同类型的塑料并分类回收。他们还设计了用太阳能驱动的机器人，让它对环境友好。简直不要太厉害！如果你能发明一个帮助环境的机器人，它会做什么呢？

最后，艺术和音乐在一个名为"友谊色彩"的精彩项目中让不同国家的孩子们聚在一起。来自日本、巴西和加拿大的孩子们一起创作了展示他们文化和梦想的美丽壁画。他们已经共同完成了50多幅壁画，每一幅都讲述着跨越国界的友谊故事。想象一下，你拿着画笔，混合鲜艳的颜色，和来自世界各地的朋友一起创造神奇的作品。这个项目还启发了一张音乐专辑，孩子们用他们的母语和英语演唱各自国家的传统歌曲。孩子们已经认识到艺术可以无需言语地连接人们。你想参加这样的项目，通过艺术分享你的文化吗？

今天的新闻就到这里！记住要继续探索和发现周围的新事物。再见！
