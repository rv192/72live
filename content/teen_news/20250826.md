## English Version
**(Intro Music with upbeat tempo)**

**Host:** News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! ...glowing oceans, super smart kid-robots, and art that connects the world!

**(Sound of gentle waves, transitioning to a magical sparkle effect)**

**Host:** Our first story takes us to the beautiful coastlines of two very different places: Chile in South America and Australia in Oceania. Over the past few weeks, people in both places have witnessed something truly magical. The ocean has started to glow in the dark!

This amazing event is called bioluminescence (bio-lu-mi-nes-cence), which is when living things, like tiny sea creatures called plankton, create their own light. When the water is moved by waves or a boat, these little creatures flash a brilliant blue light. It's like the ocean has millions of tiny, living stars floating inside it. Scientists have reported that the recent glows have been unusually bright and large. In a bay in Australia, the glowing area was so huge that it covered a space equivalent to 50,000 Olympic swimming pools! Imagine seeing that from a plane at night; it would look like a giant, glowing blue cloud on the water.

Let's try an imaginative exercise. Close your eyes. Imagine you are standing on a quiet, dark beach in Chile. You can hear the soft sound of waves washing ashore. As a wave crashes near your feet, the water doesn't turn white with foam. Instead, it erupts in a silent explosion of electric blue light! You dip your hand in the water, and it feels cool, but your fingers are now sparkling with tiny blue lights. You can feel the wonder of nature right in your hands. This phenomenon has attracted many tourists and photographers, who have taken some *spectacular/amazing* photos of the sparkling seas. Scientists are studying if changes in ocean temperature might be making these plankton populations grow bigger and brighter. They believe it is a beautiful, but also important, signal from our oceans.

This natural light show is a powerful reminder of how many mysteries our planet holds. These tiny plankton, too small to see with your eyes alone, can work together to create something so big and beautiful that it can be seen from space. It makes you think about the power of teamwork, doesn't it? If you had the chance to see this glowing ocean, what would you do first? Would you swim in it, take a picture, or just sit and watch the incredible show?

**(Sound of gears turning and small motors whirring)**

**Host:** Now, let's zoom from natural wonders to human-made marvels! Our second story is about the annual "Global Young Inventors Challenge," and the results have just been announced. This year's theme was "Cleaning Our Planet," and a team of three middle school students from Kyoto, Japan, has won the grand prize with their amazing robot, the "Beach Bot."

This isn't a big, factory-made robot. The Beach Bot is small, runs on solar power, and has a very special job: it finds and collects microplastics (my-kro-plas-tics), which are tiny pieces of plastic pollution that are very hard to clean up. The students, aged 12 to 14, have spent over a year designing and building their *prototype/model*. They used 3D printers to create its parts and wrote the computer code themselves to teach the robot how to recognize the difference between a small shell and a piece of plastic. It's a truly brilliant idea!

During the final competition, the Beach Bot was tested on a special sandy area. In just one hour, it collected thousands of tiny plastic fragments. The judges were amazed! If you were to line up all the microplastics the bot collected in that single hour, the line would stretch for over 80 meters. That is as long as three big school buses parked end to end! This shows how a small robot can have a huge impact. The kids explained that they felt sad when they saw pictures of birds and fish that had eaten plastic, so they wanted to do something to help. They have already shared their design online for free, so other students around the world can build their own Beach Bots.

Let's have another moment of imagination. Picture yourself in a busy workshop filled with tools, computers, and half-finished inventions. You can hear the buzz of creative energy. You and your friends are working together, attaching the final wheel to your own little robot. You feel a great sense of excitement and pride because you know this machine, which you built with your own hands, is going to do something good for the world. That's exactly how the team from Kyoto must have felt. Their success has inspired a new generation of inventors. So, if you could design a robot to help the planet, what special job would you give it?

**(Sound of gentle, creative music with light brush strokes)**

**Host:** For our final story, we are flying to Madrid, the capital of Spain, to see a new work of art. But this is no ordinary painting. It's a giant mural (myoo-ral), which is a painting done directly on a wall, and it was created by thousands of people from over 100 different countries!

The project, called "Pixel to Paint," started online. An artist drew a simple outline of a giant tree with many branches on a website. People from anywhere in the world could then log in, choose a color, and paint one small square—like a digital pixel. Over a month, more than 50,000 people contributed their "pixel" of color. Some painted leaves, others colored the trunk, and some added birds and flowers. This *collaborative/cooperative* effort turned the simple black-and-white drawing into a vibrant and colorful masterpiece.

After the digital version was complete, a team of artists in Madrid started painting the final design on the side of a large building in the city center. The final mural is incredible! It's as tall as a four-story building and covers an area large enough for you to park 10 cars on it. People who see it feel a connection to the thousands of anonymous artists who helped create it. Each tiny spot of color represents a person who wanted to be part of something beautiful.

This project shows how technology and art can bring people together in a positive way. Why not try this at home? You can take a large piece of paper and draw a simple shape. Then, ask your family and friends to each pick a crayon or marker and color in one small part. Don't tell them what the final picture should look like! When everyone has finished, you will have a unique piece of art that you all created together. What picture do you think would best represent teamwork and friendship on a giant mural?

**(Outro Music starts)**

**Host:** That's all the time we have for today's News Discovery Time. Keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep being awesome! See you next time!

  **(欢快的开场音乐)**

**主持人：** 新闻探索时间！今天我们要猛烈探索……Bang! Pop! Wow! ……发光的海洋、超级聪明的儿童机器人，还有连接世界的艺术！

**(轻柔的海浪声，转为神奇的闪光音效)**

**主持人：** 我们的第一条新闻，要带我们去两个完全不同的地方的美丽海岸线：南美洲的智利和大洋洲的澳大利亚。在过去几周里，这两个地方的人们都亲眼见证了一些真正神奇的事情。大海，居然在晚上发光了！

这个奇妙的现象叫做“生物发光”（bioluminescence），就是指像浮游生物这种微小的海洋生物，它们自己能制造光。当海水被波浪或者船只搅动时，这些小生物就会闪烁出灿烂的蓝光。感觉就像海洋里漂浮着千百万颗活生生的小星星。科学家们报告说，最近的发光现象异常明亮和广阔。在澳大利亚的一个海湾，发光区域的面积大得惊人，相当于50,000个奥运会标准游泳池那么大！想象一下晚上从飞机上看，那肯定就像一朵巨大的、发着蓝光的云彩浮在水面上。

我们来做一个想象练习。闭上眼睛。想象你正站在智利一个安静、漆黑的沙滩上。你能听到海浪拍打岸边的轻柔声音。当一波浪花冲到你的脚边时，海水并没有变成白色的泡沫，而是瞬间爆发出一片电光蓝，简直就像魔法一样！你把手伸进水里，感觉凉凉的，但你的手指上现在正闪烁着蓝色的小光点。你亲手感受到了大自然的神奇。这个现象吸引了好多游客和摄影师，他们拍下了很多关于闪光大海的超赞照片。科学家们正在研究，是不是海洋温度的变化让这些浮游生物长得更多、更亮了。他们认为，这既是一个美丽的景象，也是来自我们海洋的一个重要信号。

这场自然的灯光秀有力地提醒着我们，地球上还藏着数不清的秘密。这些小小的浮游生物，小到我们用肉眼都看不见，但它们团结起来，就能创造出从太空中都能看到的宏伟景象。这让你想到团队合作的力量，对不对？如果你有机会看到这片发光的海洋，你会先做什么呢？是跳进去游泳，还是拍照，或者只是静静地坐着欣赏这场不可思议的表演？

**(齿轮转动和小型马达的嗡嗡声)**

**主持人：** 好了，让我们从自然奇观转向人造的奇迹！我们的第二条新闻是关于一年一度的“全球青年发明家挑战赛”，比赛结果刚刚公布啦。今年的主题是“清洁我们的星球”，一个由三名来自日本京都的中学生组成的团队，凭借他们超棒的机器人“沙滩机器人”，赢得了一等奖。

这可不是一个工厂里造出来的大机器人哦。“沙滩机器人”很小，用太阳能驱动，而且它有一个非常特殊的任务：寻找并收集“微塑料”（microplastics），这些塑料小碎片是特别难清理的污染物。这些年龄在12到14岁之间的学生，花了一年多的时间来设计和制造他们的机器人“原型”（prototype/model）。他们用3D打印机制作零件，还自己编写电脑程序，教机器人如何区分一个小贝壳和一块塑料。这个想法简直不要太厉害！

在最后的比赛中，“沙滩机器人”在一个特殊的沙地上进行了测试。只用了一个小时，它就收集了成千上万个微小的塑料碎片。评委们都惊呆了！如果你把机器人在那一小时里收集到的所有微塑料排成一条线，这条线能有80多米长。这相当于三辆大学校巴士首尾相连那么长！这说明一个小小的机器人也能产生巨大的影响。孩子们解释说，当他们看到鸟和鱼误食塑料的照片时感到很难过，所以想做点事来帮忙。他们已经把设计图免费分享到了网上，这样全世界其他的学生也可以制造自己的“沙滩机器人”了。

让我们再来一次想象。想象自己在一个忙碌的工作坊里，到处都是工具、电脑和没完成的发明。你能听到这里充满了创造力的嗡嗡声。你和朋友们正一起合作，给你自己的小机器人装上最后一个轮子。你感到无比兴奋和自豪，因为你知道，这台你亲手制造的机器，将要为世界做一件好事。来自京都的那个团队一定就是这种感觉。他们的成功激励了新一代的发明家。那么，如果你可以设计一个机器人来帮助地球，你会给它什么特殊的工作呢？

**(轻柔、富有创意的音乐，伴随着画笔涂抹的声音)**

**主持人：** 最后一则新闻，我们要飞往西班牙的首都马德里，去看一件新的艺术品。但这不是一幅普通的画。它是一幅巨大的“壁画”（mural），也就是直接画在墙上的画，而且它是由来自100多个国家的好几千人共同创作的！

这个叫做“从像素到画作”的项目是从网上开始的。一位艺术家在一个网站上画了一棵大树的简单轮廓，树上有很多树枝。全世界任何地方的人都可以登录，选择一种颜色，然后涂满一个小方格——就像一个电子像素。在一个月的时间里，超过五万名网友贡献了他们的色彩“像素”。一些人画了叶子，一些人给树干上色，还有人添加了小鸟和花朵。这种“合作的”（collaborative/cooperative）努力，把一幅简单的黑白画变成了一件色彩斑斓的杰作。

在网络版完成后，马德里的一组艺术家开始把最终的设计画在市中心一栋大楼的墙壁上。完成后的壁画太壮观了！它有四层楼那么高，覆盖的面积大到可以停下10辆小汽车。看到它的人们，都会感觉自己和那成千上万名匿名的创作者联系在了一起。每一个微小的色点，都代表着一个想要参与创造美好事物的人。

这个项目展示了科技和艺术如何用一种积极的方式将人们联系在一起。要不要在家里也试试？你可以拿一张大纸，画一个简单的形状。然后，让你的家人和朋友们每人选一支蜡笔或马克笔，在上面涂一小块颜色。不要告诉他们最终要画成什么样！等所有人都画完后，你就会拥有一件你们共同创作的独特艺术品，是不是超有意思？你认为什么样的图案最能在一幅巨型壁画上代表团队合作和友谊呢？

**(结尾音乐响起)**

**主持人：** 这就是今天新闻探索时间的全部内容啦。继续探索，继续提问，继续做最棒的自己！我们下次再见！
