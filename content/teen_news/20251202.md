News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow! From magical glowing forests to amazing apps built by students just like you, we have some incredible stories to share.

Our first piece of news has come from the deep, quiet parts of the Amazon rainforest. Scientists have recently announced a breathtaking discovery: a huge area of glowing mushrooms! These aren't just any mushrooms; they have been given the name 'Luna Caps' because they shine with a soft, green light, very similar to the gentle light of the moon.

Imagine you are walking in a dark forest at night, with no flashlight. The air is cool and filled with the sounds of insects. Suddenly, you see the ground beneath your feet start to glow. It’s not scary; it feels magical. This is what explorers have experienced. The glowing area is enormous! It covers about 50,000 square meters. To help you picture that, it's like 10 American football fields all put together, shining brightly in the dark. Dr. Lena Petrova, the lead biologist on the project, said, "We have seen glowing fungi before, but we have never seen anything on this scale. The light is bright enough to read a book by." Scientists believe the mushrooms glow to attract insects, which then help spread their spores. This discovery is truly *remarkable* (amazing/special) and reminds us that our planet is still full of secrets. If you discovered a new glowing plant, what would you name it?

Next up, we're blasting off from the forest and into the world of technology! And the best part? This story is about students your age who have made a real difference. A team of four middle school students from Maple Creek School has developed a fantastic new mobile app called 'Recycle-Right'.

We have all felt confused about recycling before. Is this plastic bottle recyclable? What about this pizza box? The 'Recycle-Right' app solves this problem. You just use your phone's camera to scan an item's barcode, and the app instantly tells you if it can be recycled and how to do it correctly. The students have worked tirelessly on this project for over eight months.

Picture this: you've just finished a drink. Instead of just throwing the can away, you pull out your phone, open the app, and scan it. A happy green checkmark appears, and it even shows you a map to the nearest special recycling bin. The app has already been downloaded over 20,000 times since its launch last month! Let's think about that number. If each of those users recycled just one extra aluminum can because of the app, the energy saved would be enough to power a home television for 60,000 hours! That is almost seven years of non-stop TV watching. The student team said they wanted to *innovate* (create something new/invent) a simple tool to help everyone protect our environment. They have shown us that a great idea, combined with some hard work, can have a huge impact. If you could create an app to solve a problem in your school or city, what would it do?

For our final story, we are getting creative. In the city of Brighton, a massive community art project has begun, and everyone is invited to join in! It’s called the "River of Colors" mural. A huge, boring grey wall that runs alongside the city's canal is being transformed into a work of art.

The wall is incredibly long, stretching for 500 meters. That is the same length as five professional soccer fields laid end-to-end! The project organizers have painted a basic outline of a flowing river with fish, birds, and trees. Now, they are asking residents, especially young people, to come and help fill in the colors.

Think about standing in front of this giant wall with a paintbrush in your hand. You feel the cool breeze from the water and hear the happy chatter of other painters. You can choose a small section—maybe a fish's scale or a leaf on a tree—and paint it in your favorite color. Your small contribution will become part of a huge, *vibrant* (colorful/lively) masterpiece that thousands of people will see every day. The goal is not just to make the wall beautiful, but also to bring the community together. People who have never met before are now painting side-by-side, sharing ideas and laughter. Artists have already started, and the first section looks amazing. This project proves that art is for everyone, not just for museums. If you had a small section of this giant mural to paint, what picture or message would you share with the world?

That’s all the news we have for today. Keep exploring, stay curious, and maybe you’ll be the one making headlines next time!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要猛烈发掘……嘭！啪！哇！从神奇的发光森林，到跟你我一样棒的学生们开发的超酷应用程序，我们有一些超乎想象的故事要分享给大家。

我们的第一条新闻来自亚马逊雨林深处、静悄悄的地方。科学家们最近宣布了一项惊人的发现：一大片会发光的蘑菇！这些可不是普通的蘑菇哦，它们被命名为“月光盖”，因为它们会散发出柔和的绿色光芒，就跟温柔的月光一样。

想象一下，晚上你正在一座漆黑的森林里走路，没有手电筒。空气凉飕飕的，充满了虫子的叫声。突然，你看见脚下的地面开始发光。这一点也不吓人，反而感觉像进入了魔法世界。这就是探险家们体验到的感觉。这片发光区域的面积大得惊人！它覆盖了大约五万平方米。为了让你能更好地想象，这就好比把120个标准篮球场拼在一起，在黑暗中闪闪发光。这个项目的首席生物学家莉娜·彼得罗娃博士说：“我们以前见过会发光的菌类，但从没见过规模这么大的。这光亮得都可以在旁边看书了。”科学家们认为，蘑菇发光是为了吸引昆虫，然后让昆虫帮助它们传播孢（bāo）子。这个发现简直不要太厉害了！它提醒我们，我们的地球上仍然充满了各种各样的秘密。如果你发现了一种新的发光植物，你会给它取什么名字呢？

接下来，我们要从森林里“发射”到科技世界啦！最棒的是，这个故事的主角是一群和你差不多大的学生，他们做出了真正的改变。来自枫溪中学的四名学生组成了一个团队，开发了一款超赞的手机新应用，叫做“环保回收通”。

我们大家肯定都对垃圾分类感到过困惑。这个塑料瓶能回收吗？那个披萨盒子怎么办？“环保回收通”这个应用就解决了这个问题。你只需要用手机摄像头扫描一下物品的条形码，应用就会立刻告诉你它是否可以回收，以及如何正确回收。为了这个项目，学生们不知疲倦地忙活了八个多月。

来，想象这个场景：你刚喝完一瓶饮料。你没有直接把瓶子扔掉，而是拿出手机，打开这个应用扫了一下。屏幕上立刻出现一个开心的绿色对勾，它甚至还给你显示了一张地图，告诉你最近的专用回收箱在哪里。这可真是太方便了！这款应用自从上个月发布以来，下载量已经超过了两万次！我们来算算这个数字。如果每个用户都因为这个应用多回收了一个铝罐，那省下来的能源就足够一台家里的电视机播放六万个小时！这差不多是连续看七年的电视啊。学生团队说，他们想创造一个简单的工具，来帮助每个人保护我们的环境。他们向我们证明了，一个好点子，加上一些努力，就能产生巨大的影响。如果你可以创造一个应用来解决学校或城市里的一个问题，你会做什么呢？

我们的最后一条新闻，要来点创造性的。在布莱顿市，一个大型的社区艺术项目已经启动，而且邀请所有人加入！它被称为“色彩之河”壁画。一条沿着城市运河的、巨大又无聊的灰色墙壁，正在被改造成一件艺术品。

这面墙长得不得了，足足有500米。这相当于五个标准足球场首尾相连的长度！项目组织者已经在墙上画好了一条流动河流的基本轮廓，里面有鱼、鸟和树木。现在，他们正邀请居民们，特别是年轻人，来帮忙填充颜色。

想想看，你手里拿着画笔，站在这面巨大的墙前。你感觉到从水面吹来的凉爽微风，听到其他画画的人开心的聊天声。你可以选一小块地方——可能是一片鱼鳞或树上的一片叶子——然后涂上你最喜欢的颜色。你的这一点点贡献，将会成为一幅巨大、生机勃勃的杰作的一部分，每天都会有成千上万的人看到它。这个项目的目的不仅仅是把墙变漂亮，更是为了把整个社区的人聚在一起。以前从不认识的人，现在正并肩画画，分享想法和笑声。艺术家们已经开工了，第一部分看起来美极了。快来大展身手吧！这个项目证明了艺术属于每一个人，不只是属于博物馆。如果让你在这面巨大的壁画上画一小块地方，你会画什么图案或分享什么信息给世界呢？

以上就是我们今天所有的新闻。请保持探索，保持好奇，也许下一次，头条新闻的主角就是你！
