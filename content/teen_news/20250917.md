News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

**Amazing Nature Sightings Across Continents!**

Scientists have discovered something incredible! In both Asia and Africa, animals have been showing extraordinary behaviors that have amazed researchers. In China, rare birds have been seen migrating earlier than usual, while in Kenya, elephants have developed new ways to find water during dry seasons.

Researchers have observed these changes over the past three years. They believe climate change might be affecting animal behavior across different continents. The distance these animals travel is equivalent to 2,500 football fields! Imagine you standing on the African savanna at sunset, watching elephants march toward a waterhole while colorful birds fly overhead in the Asian sky. If you were a scientist studying these animals, what questions would you ask them?

**Space Technology with Young Helpers**

The China National Space Administration (CNSA, 中国国家航天局) has successfully completed another rocket engine test! What makes this special? Students from Beijing No. 4 Middle School participated in the control room observation program.

The rocket engine burned for 320 seconds, creating enough power to lift 20 school buses at once! Picture yourself sitting in the mission control center, watching the big screens display the rocket's performance while scientists cheer wildly beside you.

Several teenagers have been helping engineers analyze data from these tests. They've been using special computer programs to study the information. "I felt like I was in a movie," said Li Ming, a 15-year-old student who joined the program. If you could help design a space mission, what would you like to explore?

**Art Workshop Fun**

The International Children's Art Festival has announced exciting news! This year's theme will be "Our Colorful World," and kids from all over the world are invited to participate.

Over 10,000 children from 50 countries have joined the festival. That's enough artworks to cover (cover/display) 50 basketball courts! Imagine your drawing displayed in a big gallery with children from every continent admiring your work.

For those who want to create at home, here's a simple idea: collect colorful leaves from your neighborhood, arrange them on paper to make an animal shape, and glue them down. Add details with colored pencils to bring your creation to life! What kind of animal would you make with natural materials?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要狂飙探索... 噼！啪！哇！

**跨大陆的神奇自然现象！**

科学家们发现了一些令人惊奇的事情！在亚洲和非洲，动物们展现出了让研究人员惊叹的行为。在中国，稀有鸟类被观察到比往年更早开始迁徙，而在肯尼亚，大象发展出了在旱季寻找水源的新方法。

研究人员在过去的三年里观察到了这些变化。他们认为气候变化可能正在影响不同大洲的动物行为。这些动物旅行的距离相当于2500个足球场那么远！想象你站在非洲大草原的日落时分，看着大象向水坑行进的同时，亚洲的天空中五彩缤纷的鸟儿在头顶飞翔。如果你是研究这些动物的科学家，你会向它们提出什么问题？

**小小少年参与太空科技**

中国航天科技集团有限公司（CASC，中国航天科技集团有限公司）成功完成了又一次火箭发动机测试！是什么让这次测试特别特别呢？来自北京四中的学生们参与了控制室观察计划。

火箭引擎燃烧了320秒，产生的动力足以同时举起20辆校车！想象你坐在任务控制中心，看着大屏幕显示火箭的表现，而科学家们在旁边疯狂欢呼。

几名青少年一直在帮助工程师分析这些测试的数据。他们使用特殊的计算机程序来研究这些信息。"我感觉就像在电影里一样，"参与该项目的15岁学生小明说。如果你能帮助设计一个太空任务，你想要探索什么？

**艺术工作坊乐趣多**

国际儿童艺术节宣布了令人兴奋的消息！今年的主题将是"我们多彩的世界"，来自世界各地的孩子们都被邀请参与。

已有来自50个国家的超过10000名儿童参加了这个艺术节。这些艺术品数量足以铺满50个篮球场！想象你的作品在大画廊里展出，来自各大洲的孩子们都在欣赏你的创作。

对于想要在家创作的朋友，这里有个简单的创意：收集你社区里五彩缤纷的树叶，把它们排列在纸上做成动物形状，然后粘好。用彩色铅笔添加细节，让你的作品栩栩如生！你想用天然材料制作什么动物呢？
