## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today, we're going to explore some fascinating stories happening around the world! Get ready for some exciting news!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

Our first amazing adventure takes us across several continents. Have you heard of Ethan Guo (伊桑·郭)? He's a brave 19-year-old pilot from the United States (美国). Ethan has a super bold dream: to fly his small airplane, a Cessna 182 (塞斯纳 182), all by himself to *every* continent on Earth! So far, he has already flown across six continents! Can you *feel* how exciting that must be? His incredible journey is also for a great cause; he is hoping to raise 1 million US dollars (差不多七百万人民币) for cancer research to help sick children get better.

But his big adventure recently hit a little bump down in Antarctica (南极洲). He was flying towards King George Island (乔治王岛), an island claimed by Chile (智利). However, Chilean authorities have stopped him there. They said he had submitted a flight plan, which is like a map and schedule for his flight, but he didn't fly exactly where he said he would. This activated some special rules!

Imagine you are flying high above the icy, white landscape of Antarctica. Below you, you see nothing but snow, maybe some fluffy penguins waddling around! Suddenly, you have to land on a small island. That island, King George Island, is about the size of a big, busy city you might know, like London (伦敦)! Ethan has been charged with breaking some local flying rules and possibly even violating (违反/break) the Antarctic Treaty (南极条约), which is a special agreement about how countries act in Antarctica. He has posted a short message saying, "I'm alive everyone, I'll make an update soon." We can hear his voice, perhaps feeling a bit surprised but okay!

His journey has already lasted over 140 days! That's like flying for more than four months! It’s a truly tremendous (巨大的/huge) undertaking for someone so young.

If you wanted to do something amazing that takes you to faraway places, what big adventure would you try?

Next up, let's blast off with some tech news involving students! Get ready to hear something super cool from Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学), a famous university in China. They have created their admission letters for new students, which are the official papers saying "Welcome, you're in!" These letters are extra special this year. They are made using the *same kind* of amazing material that is used in real Chinese spacecraft, like the Mengzhou (梦舟) spaceship and the Tianwen-2 (天问二号) probe! Imagine *feeling* the texture of something that could travel to Mars!

But the most awesome part? The university has decided to send the names of *all* their new 2025 students into space! Yes, your name could literally travel among the stars on a tiny satellite! The university has already launched 36 satellites into space before. This next satellite will carry thousands of student names etched onto that special, lightweight material.

Imagine the tiny satellite, far, far above the Earth, zooming silently through the black sky with countless stars all around. And on that satellite, written on a piece of special metal, are thousands of names. If you lined up all those student names, it would be more names than in your entire school! That’s pretty incredible, isn't it?

Think about it, knowing your name has been up there, orbiting our planet! It really makes you feel connected to science and space exploration.

If you could send something small to space on a satellite, what would it be and why would you choose that?

For our third story, let's explore some wonderful culture and get hands-on! This summer, some students from a special care program in Anhui (安徽) province, China, had a fantastic field trip. They visited a company that focuses on Traditional Chinese Medicine (中医药), or TCM. TCM is an ancient (古老的/very old) medical system from China that uses plants and other natural things to help people feel better. It’s been around for thousands of years!

The students got to be like little scientists and explorers for the day. They visited a special park called a Wenbo Park (文博园) and learned all about different herbs. They saw how traditional medicine ingredients are processed, even getting to see the special way a famous herb called Huoshan Dendrobium (霍山石斛) is prepared using techniques that are part of China's intangible cultural heritage (非物质文化遗产) – things like traditional crafts or performances that are passed down through families and communities. They learned about the long history of TCM and even got to taste some healthy herbal tea.

Imagine you walk into a room filled with the lovely smell of different plants and herbs. You see people carefully working with these natural ingredients, maybe twisting or drying them, using methods that are centuries old. You feel the different textures and perhaps even get to try making something yourself! Learning about TCM isn't just about history; it's about understanding how people have used nature for health for thousands of years, and seeing the incredible benefit (好处/good effect) these traditions still offer today.

Chinese traditional medicine is over 2,000 years old! That's like many, many lifetimes ago! It's amazing how this knowledge has traveled through so much time.

What kind of traditional craft or skill, like making something or performing, would you like to try learning?

**Hands-On Suggestion:** Why not try making your own safe, simple 'herbal' tea at home? Ask an adult to help you put some kitchen ingredients like fresh ginger slices, mint leaves, or dried fruit pieces into hot water. Let it sit for a few minutes, then carefully strain and taste! See how different combinations smell and taste, and maybe you'll discover a new favourite healthy drink!

That's all for today's exciting news discoveries! Stay curious and keep exploring the world around you!

新闻探险时间到！今天我们要去探索世界各地发生的趣事啦！准备好接收超酷的新闻吧！

砰！嘭！哇！

我们的第一个精彩探险要跨越好几个大洲！你听说过伊桑·郭（Ethan Guo）吗？他是一个来自美国（Měiguó）的勇敢的19岁飞行员。伊桑有一个超级大胆的梦想：他要自己驾驶他的小飞机——一架塞斯纳 182（Cessna 182），飞遍地球上的每一个大洲！到目前为止，他已经飞越了六个大洲了！你是不是光听着就感觉特别激动？他的这段不可思议的旅程还是为了一个非常有意义的事情；他希望能为癌症研究筹集到100万美元（差不多七百万人民币），来帮助生病的孩子们好起来。

但是，他的南极洲（Nánjízhōu）探险最近遇到了一个小小的状况。他正飞往乔治王岛（King George Island），这座岛是智利（Zhìlì）声称拥有的地方。结果，智利当局在那里拦下了他。他们说他之前提交了一份飞行计划，就像是飞行的路线图和时间表，但是他没有完全按照计划去飞。这一下就触发了一些特别的规定！

想象一下，你正飞在高高的、白茫茫的南极上空。往下看，除了雪什么都看不到，也许还有几只胖胖的企鹅在摇摇摆摆地走。突然，你必须降落在一个小岛上！乔治王岛，这个岛跟咱们熟知的大城市差不多大，比如伦敦（Lúndūn）！伊桑被指控违反（wéifǎn）了一些当地的飞行规定，甚至可能还违反了南极条约（Nánjí Tiáoyuē）——这是一个关于各个国家如何在南极行动的特别协议。他发了一条简短的消息说：“大家我活着呢，很快会发更新。”我们能“听”到他的声音，可能有点惊讶，但还好！

他的旅程已经持续了140多天了！那可不是一两个月，而是飞行了四个多月！对于这么年轻的他来说，这真是一件非常了不起（非常棒/great）的任务。

要是你，你会去尝试什么了不起的大冒险？

接下来，让我们带着科技，一起“发射”吧！准备好听一个和学生们有关的超酷消息！来自中国一所著名大学——哈尔滨工业大学（Hā'ěrbīn Gōngyè Dàxué），他们为新同学们准备的录取通知书（lùqǔ tōngzhīshū）太特别了！今年的通知书竟然使用了和真正中国航天器一样的神奇材料，比如“梦舟（Mèng Zhōu）”飞船和“天问二号（Tiānwèn èr hào）”探测器用到的材料！想象一下，摸一摸和去过火星的探测器一样的材料，是什么感觉！

但最最劲爆（最厉害/amazing）的部分是？这所大学决定把他们所有2025级新生的名字送上太空！没错，你的名字真的有机会随着一颗小卫星一起去星星那里旅行！这所大学之前已经发射了36颗卫星进入太空了。这下一颗卫星会带着数千个新生的名字，刻在那种特别又很轻的材料上。

想象一下，一颗小小的卫星，离地球远远的，在漆黑的宇宙里悄悄地飞着，周围是数不清的星星。就在这颗卫星上，一块特殊的金属材料上，刻着数千个名字。如果把所有这些学生的名字加起来，那可比你们整个学校的学生人数还要多呢！简直不要太厉害！

想想看，知道你的名字曾经在太空里，围绕着咱们的地球转啊转，是不是感觉和科学、和太空探索有了特别的连接？

如果让你送一件小东西去太空，你会送什么？为什么呢？

我们的第三个故事，一起来探索美好的文化，亲手做点东西吧！今年暑假，在中国安徽（Ānhuī）省的一个暑期托管班里，一些同学们参加了一次很棒的户外学习活动。他们参观了一个专门研究中医药（Zhōngyīyào）的公司。中医药是中国非常古老（非常老旧/ancient）的医学体系，用植物和其他天然的东西来帮助人们更健康。它已经有几千年的历史啦！

同学们那天就像小小科学家和探险家一样。他们参观了一个叫做文博园（Wénbó Yuán）的特别园区，了解了各种各样的药草。他们看到了传统的药材是怎么被制作出来的，甚至还亲身体验了一种叫做霍山石斛（Huòshān Shíhú）的特别药草，学习怎么用非物质文化遗产（fēiwùzhì wénhuà yíchǎn）的方法来制作它——非物质文化遗产就像是通过家人和社区一代代传下来的老手艺或表演。他们还学习了中医药悠久的发展史，甚至品尝了一些健康的草本花茶。

想象一下，你走进一个屋子，里面全是各种药草的清香。你看到人们小心翼翼地处理这些来自大自然的宝贝，可能是在搓揉，或者是在晒干，用的都是几百年前人们就在用的方法。你摸一摸不同的药材，感受它们的质地，也许还能亲手试着做一点！学习中医药不仅仅是学习历史；更是了解几千年来人们是如何利用大自然来保持健康的，看看这些古老的传统至今还在发挥着多么重要的好处（hǎochù）。

中医药文化有两千多年历史啦！这可比你爷爷奶奶的爷爷奶奶辈还要早得多得多！真是个增长见识的好机会！

除了中医药，你还想学学什么老手艺呢？

**动手试试看：** 要不试试在家里做自己的安全又简单的“草药”茶？请大人帮忙，把一些厨房里常见的材料，比如新鲜的姜片、薄荷叶或者干的水果块，放进热水里。等几分钟，然后小心地过滤掉里面的东西，就可以尝尝啦！看看不同的组合闻起来和尝起来有什么不一样，也许你会发现一种新的健康饮品！

今天的精彩新闻发现就到这里啦！保持好奇心，继续探索你周围的世界吧！
