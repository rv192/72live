News Discovery Time! Today, we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Our first stop is Mexico, where nature has shown its incredible power. A very **severe** (bad) hurricane, named Otis, hit the southern coast. Imagine a giant, spinning cloud monster coming from the ocean! This hurricane quickly became a Category 3 storm, which is super strong, with winds blowing up to 205 kilometers per hour. Can you imagine wind faster than a racing car? That's how strong it was!

The storm brought a lot of rain and strong winds to places like Puerto Escondido (普埃尔托埃斯孔迪多), a town in Oaxaca (瓦哈卡) state. We have heard that the wind sounded like a roaring train! We have seen pictures and felt sad because the storm caused damage to important buildings, which we call **infrastructure** (important buildings and systems like hospitals and roads). Two hospitals were affected. Streets were flooded, like big rivers running through the town. Many people had no electricity; the lights just went out in over 120,000 homes in Oaxaca state! That’s like a whole city suddenly going dark. Think about not being able to turn on the lights, watch TV, or charge your phone. It must have felt very strange and difficult.

But even in this tough time, we have seen wonderful things. Hundreds of soldiers have come to help with the **clean-up** (clearing/tidying). They are like a big team working together to make things better. They are clearing roads, moving fallen trees, and helping people fix their homes. People in the community are also helping each other. We have heard stories of neighbours sharing food and water. It shows that even when nature is powerful, people are stronger together.

The water level in some areas was incredibly high. One businessman said the water had "never reached this level" before. Imagine the water coming up as high as your front door! That’s really high! The government has opened about 2,000 **shelters** (safe places to stay), so people whose homes were damaged have a safe place to sleep and eat. We have also heard that the president has asked everyone to stay safe and listen to advice.

The hurricane is now getting weaker, which is good news. But the clean-up work will take time. People are working hard every day to make Puerto Escondido and other areas normal again. It is a big job, but they are doing it together.

Now, imagine you are standing on a street in Puerto Escondido after the storm. You *see* the mess, the fallen trees, the mud. You *hear* the sounds of people working, helping, talking. You *feel* the warm sun starting to shine again, and you also feel the hope that things will get better.

Here's an open question for you: If a big natural event like this hurricane happened near your home, what three important things would you pack in a small bag to take with you? And what's one way you could help people who have lost things?

Our next news story takes us to France, a country famous for its beautiful vineyards and delicious champagne. But even in beautiful places, there can be problems. This story is about helping people who come to work in the vineyards for a short time. These are called **seasonal workers** (people who work during a specific season, like harvest time).

We have learned about a situation where more than 50 seasonal workers were not treated fairly. These workers came from countries in West Africa, like Mali (马里), Mauritania (毛里塔尼亚), Côte d'Ivoire (科特迪瓦), and Senegal (塞内加尔). They traveled a very long way to work in France. Imagine travelling across continents, very far from your home and family, to find work.

These workers were helping to pick grapes during the harvest season. Picking grapes is hard work, often done under the sun. But the news tells us their working **conditions** (the situation they were in) were not good. They worked very long hours, sometimes 10 hours a day. That's much longer than a school day! And they only had a very short break for lunch, just 30 minutes. They also didn't have proper work agreements, and the money they got didn't seem fair for the amount of work they did.

What was also difficult was where they had to live. They were found in a building that was very crowded and not clean. Imagine many, many people living together in a very small space, with not enough clean bathrooms or showers. It sounds like it would be very uncomfortable and difficult to rest after a long day of working in the fields.

Now, the good news is that people are trying to help these workers. There is a trial happening, which is like a court case, to try and make things fair for them and for other workers in the future. Three people are involved in this case. People who work to make rules (like in the government or worker groups called unions) are saying this is not right. They want to **ensure** (make sure) that everyone who works, especially those who come from far away to do important jobs like picking grapes, is treated well and gets fair pay and a safe place to live.

Imagine you are one of these seasonal workers. You have come to a new country, ready to work hard in the lovely vineyards. You *see* the rows and rows of ripe grapes, ready to be picked. You *feel* happy to have a job, but then you *see* the crowded room where you must sleep, and you *feel* tired after working for 10 hours with only a short break. Now, imagine someone is trying to help you, speaking up for you to make things better. Doesn't that *sound* like a really important thing?

This situation reminds us that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and fairness, no matter where they come from or what job they do. Efforts like this trial are important steps to **support** (help/assist) vulnerable workers and make sure everyone has fair working conditions.

Here’s an open question for you: Why do you think it's important for everyone to have a safe place to live and fair working hours? What's one way we can show kindness and understanding to people who might be new to our community or country?

新闻发现时间到！今天，我們要去探索... 嘭！啪！哇！

我们的第一站是墨西哥，大自然在那里展现了它**超级强悍**的力量。一个名字叫做奥蒂斯（Otis）的**大风暴**（hurricane），冲向了南边的海岸。想象一下，一个巨大的、转呀转的云朵怪物从海里冲上来了！这个风暴**很快**就变成了3级，这可厉害了，风速能达到每小时205公里。你能想象风吹得比跑车还快吗？当时的风就是这么猛！

这场风暴给瓦哈卡（Oaxaca）州的普埃尔托埃斯孔迪多（Puerto Escondido）等地方带来了好多雨和**超级大的风**。我们听说当时风的声音听起来就像火车在吼！我们看到了照片，心里有点难过，因为风暴损坏了一些**非常重要的建筑**（infrastructure），比如医院和马路。有两个医院都受到了影响。街道上全是水，就像**小河一样**在镇子里**疾驰**。好多好多人家里都停电了；在瓦哈卡州，有超过12万户家庭的灯都**突然灭了**！那简直就像一个**完整的城市**一下子黑漆漆的。想想看，不能开灯，不能看电视，也不能给手机充电。感觉一定很奇怪也很不容易吧。

但是，即使在这么困难的时候，我们也看到了**很多美好的事情**。好几百个**解放军叔叔阿姨**（soldiers）都来帮忙**打扫清理**（clean-up）了。他们就像一个**大大的团队**，一起努力让情况变好。他们在清理马路，搬走倒下的树，还帮人们修理房子。社区里的人们也互相帮忙。我们听说邻居们分享食物和水的故事。这说明，即使大自然很强大，大家团结在一起，力量就更大了！

有些地方的水位高得吓人。一个商人叔叔说，水“从来没有到过这么高”。想象一下水**一下子涨到**你家前门那么高！真的**太高了**！政府**开启**了大约2000个**安全的小屋**（shelters），这样那些房子被损坏的人就有个安全的地方睡觉和吃饭了。我们还听说总统**叮嘱大家**都要注意安全，听从建议。

这个风暴现在**渐渐变弱**了，这是个好消息。但是清理工作需要时间。人们每天都在**努力**地让普埃尔托埃斯孔迪多和其他地方**恢复正常**。这是个大工程，但是大家在一起**齐心协力**地做。

现在，想象你站在风暴过后的普埃尔托埃斯孔迪多的一条街上。你**看到**乱糟糟的景象，倒下的树，还有泥巴。你**听到**人们**忙碌地工作**、互相帮助、说话的声音。你**感到**温暖的阳光又开始照耀了，你也能**感受到**事情会好起来的希望。

这里有一个开放问题给你：如果你的城市也遇到了像这样的大风暴，你会在一个小包里装哪三样最重要的东西带着？你觉得可以用什么方法帮助那些失去了东西的人呢？

我们的下一条新闻带我们去法国，这个国家因为美丽的葡萄园和美味的香槟而闻名。但即使在美丽的地方，也可能有问题存在。这个故事是关于帮助那些来葡萄园工作一小段时间的人。他们被称为**季节性工人**（seasonal workers），就是只在特定的季节工作的人，比如葡萄收获的时候。

我们了解到，发生了一件事，有50多个季节性工人没有得到公平的对待。这些工人从西非的国家来的，比如马里（Mali）、毛里塔尼亚（Mauritania）、科特迪瓦（Côte d'Ivoire）和塞内加尔（Senegal）。他们坐了**很远很远**的车（或者飞机）来到法国工作。想象一下，跨越好几个大洲，离家和家人都**特别远**，只为了找份工作。

这些工人在葡萄收获季节帮忙摘葡萄。摘葡萄是很辛苦的工作，通常要在太阳底下干活。但是新闻告诉我们，他们的工作**条件**（conditions），也就是他们所处的情况，并**不怎么好**。他们工作时间特别长，有时候一天要干10个小时。这可比我们上学的时间**长多了**！他们吃午饭休息的时间也**非常短**，只有30分钟。他们也没有正式的工作合同，他们拿到的钱看起来和他们付出的劳动也**不太匹配**。

更困难的是他们必须住的地方。他们被发现住在**又挤又脏**的房子里。想象一下，很多人很多很多人挤在一个**特别小**的地方，没有足够的干净厕所和淋浴。听起来，干了一天活之后，休息起来一定**很不舒服**也很困难。

不过，好消息是，现在有人正在努力帮助这些工人。正在进行一场**开庭**（trial），就像打官司一样，努力为他们和未来的工人争取公平。有三个人涉及这个案子。那些制定规则的人（比如政府部门或者叫做工会的工人组织）都说这样做**不对**。他们想**确保**（ensure）每个工作的人，特别是那些从很远的地方来做重要工作（比如摘葡萄）的人，都得到好的对待，拿到合理的工资，还有安全的地方住。

想象一下，你是这些季节性工人中的一员。你来到了一个新国家，准备在美丽的葡萄园里**努力工作**。你**看到**一行行、一排排**长满果子**的葡萄藤，等着被摘下来。你**感到**能有份工作很开心，但是你**看到**你必须要住的**又挤又小**的房间，你**感到**在太阳下干了10个小时之后**特别累**。现在，想象有人正在努力帮助你，为你说话，让情况变得更好。这听起来是不是一件**特别重要**的事情？

这个情况**提醒我们**，每个人都应该被尊重和公平对待，不管他们从哪里来，做什么样的工作。像这个开庭这样的努力是很重要的步骤，用来**支持**（support）那些比较容易受到伤害的工人，并确保每个人都有公平的工作条件。

这里有一个开放问题给你：你觉得为什么每个人都应该有一个安全的地方住和公平的工作时间？不管他们从哪里来？你觉得我们可以用什么方法，对那些刚来到我们社区或国家的人展现友善和理解呢？
