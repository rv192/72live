**Penguin Gifts: Surprising Friendship Across Continents**

Scientists have discovered an amazing friendship between penguins and leopard seals in Antarctica (南极洲) and South Africa! These usually fierce predators have been seen playing with penguins instead of eating them. Leopard seals, which can grow up to 3.5 meters long - that's as long as two bicycles placed end to end - have been gently pushing penguins around and even letting them ride on their backs!

Imagine you're standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, feeling the cold wind on your face. In the distance, you see a huge leopard seal approaching a group of penguins. But instead of running away, the penguins seem excited! The seal nudges them playfully (gently), almost like a big dog playing with small puppies. What a magical scene to witness with your own eyes!

This surprising behavior has been observed in both Antarctica and South Africa, making it a true cross-continental (involving more than one continent) phenomenon. Researchers believe this might be the first time such friendly interactions between these natural enemies have been documented. What do you think has changed in these animals' relationship? Could climate change be affecting their behavior in unexpected ways?

**Kids Help Create Amazing 3D Worlds with New AI Technology**

Exciting news from the world of technology! Stanford University's (斯坦福大学 - a famous American university) Professor Fei-Fei Li has launched a new project called Marble that lets children create their own 3D worlds using artificial intelligence (AI). This incredible technology has already helped over 500 students from 12 different countries turn their imagination into virtual reality!

The Marble program works like magic - kids can draw simple pictures or write descriptions, and the AI transforms them into detailed 3D environments they can explore. Some students have created entire cities, magical forests, and even imaginary planets! The AI has generated more than 10,000 unique 3D worlds so far, which is like building a city the size of 100 football fields!

Picture yourself sitting at a computer, drawing a quick sketch of a castle with dragons flying around. With just a few clicks, your flat drawing becomes a 3D world that you can walk through. You hear the flapping (sound of wings) of dragons overhead and feel like you're really there! This is what kids using Marble experience every day.

Ten-year-old Emma from California created a underwater (under the sea) kingdom where fish could talk, while 12-year-old Zhang Wei from Shanghai built a space station with alien friends. If you could create any world with this technology, what would you build? Would you make a place where animals could speak human language or perhaps a world without homework?

**Traditional Dance Comes Alive in Schools**

In other news, students in Tibet (西藏 - a region in China) are now learning the ancient Reba dance as part of their regular school classes! This special dance combines storytelling, singing, and acrobatics (special gymnastic movements), and was named a national cultural treasure in 2006. Today, over 3,000 students across Tibet are practicing this beautiful art form.

At Lhasa No. 2 Vocational School, students attend Reba dance classes twice a week. They learn complex movements that tell stories about Tibetan history and legends. The dance costumes are incredibly colorful, with some outfits weighing up to 5 kilograms - about the same as carrying a large backpack full of books!

Imagine walking into a schoolyard during break time. Instead of just running around, students are performing graceful Reba dance movements. The colorful costumes spin around as the dancers move to the rhythm of traditional music. You can hear the bells on their costumes jingling (making a light ringing sound) with every step, creating a beautiful soundscape.

Would you like to try learning a traditional dance from your own culture? Maybe you could ask your teachers about starting a dance club at school. Traditional arts like Reba dancing help us understand our history and keep important cultural knowledge alive for future generations. What traditions in your family or community would you like to learn more about?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索...
砰！啪！哇！

**企鹅的惊喜礼物：跨越大洲的奇特友谊**

科学家们在南极洲和南非发现了一个令人惊叹的友谊现象！通常是凶猛捕食者的豹海豹，现在竟然和企鹅一起玩耍而不是吃掉它们。这些能长到3.5米长的豹海豹——相当于两辆自行车首尾相连的长度——被发现轻轻地推着企鹅玩耍，甚至让它们骑在自己的背上！

想象你站在南极洲的冰岸上，感受着冷风吹拂脸颊。远处，你看到一只巨大的豹海豹正接近一群企鹅。但是，企鹅们不但没有逃跑，反而看起来很兴奋！那头海豹温和地推着它们，简直就像大狗和小狗崽玩耍一样。多么神奇的景象啊！

这种令人惊讶的行为在南极洲和南非都有被观察到，使其成为真正跨越大洲的现象。研究人员认为，这可能是首次记录到这些天敌之间的友好互动。你认为这些动物的关系发生了什么变化？是不是气候变化正在以意想不到的方式影响它们的行为？

**小朋友用新技术创造惊人3D世界**

科技界传来令人兴奋的消息！斯坦福大学的李飞飞教授推出了一项名为"Marble"的新项目，让小朋友能够使用人工智能创造自己的3D世界。这项令人难以置信的技术已经帮助来自12个国家的500多名学生将想象力变成虚拟现实！

Marble程序像魔法一样工作——孩子们可以画简单的图画或写描述，人工智能就能把它们变成可以详细探索的3D环境。一些学生创造了整座城市、神奇的森林，甚至是想象中的星球！到目前为止，人工智能已经生成了10,000多个独特的3D世界，这相当于建造了100个足球场那么大的城市！

想象自己坐在电脑前，画了一幅简单的城堡和飞龙草图。只需点击几下，你的平面图就变成了可以穿行的3D世界。你听到上方龙的拍打翅膀声，感觉就像真的在那里一样！这就是使用Marble的孩子们每天经历的体验。

来自加州的10岁女孩艾玛创造了一个鱼儿会说话的水下王国，而来自上海的12岁男孩张伟则建造了一个有外星朋友的太空站。如果你能用这项技术创造任何世界，你会建造什么？你会创造一个动物能说人话的世界，还是一个没有作业的世界？

**传统舞蹈在校园中焕发新生力**

其他新闻方面，西藏的学生们现在将古老的热巴舞作为常规课程的一部分来学习！这种特殊的舞蹈结合了讲故事、唱歌和杂技动作，在2006年被命名为国家级文化瑰宝。如今，西藏各地有超过3,000名学生在练习这种美丽的艺术形式。

在拉萨第二中等职业学校，学生们每周上两次热巴舞课。他们学习复杂的动作，讲述关于西藏历史和传说的故事。舞蹈服装色彩极其丰富，有些服装重量达5公斤——大约相当于背着一个装满书的大背包！

想象一下，在休息时间走进学校操场。学生们不是只是到处跑动，而是正在表演优美的热巴舞动作。随着舞者配合着传统音乐节奏舞动，色彩鲜艳的服装旋转起来。你能听到他们服装上的铃铛随着每一步发出轻柔的叮叮声，创造出一种美妙的声音景观。

你想学习自己文化的传统舞蹈吗？也许你可以问问老师在学校里成立一个舞蹈俱乐部。像热巴舞这样的传统艺术帮助我们了解历史，并将重要的文化知识保存给后代。你的家庭或社区有什么传统是你想多了解的吗？
