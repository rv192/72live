**(Sound effect: Bang! Pop! Wow!)**

...a story of incredible strength, clever adaptation, and a heart full of kindness!

Hello, fellow students, and welcome back to our news express! Today, we have a very special feature story that has truly inspired our entire team. It's about a man who has overcome amazing challenges to become a hero in his community.

Imagine this for a moment. You are standing in the narrow, busy alleys of Fenghuang Ancient Town, a famous tourist spot in China's Hunan province. You can hear the sounds of people chatting and smell delicious street food. Suddenly, you see a delivery rider skillfully weaving through the crowd on a one-wheeled electric vehicle. It looks cool, right? But then you look closer and see something truly *remarkable* (amazing / extraordinary). This delivery rider has no arms.

This is the story of Li Xiangyang. Born in 1995, he has faced a huge challenge since he was very young. When he was just four years old, a terrible accident with an electrical transformer changed his life forever. But has he let this stop him? Absolutely not! Today, he is not only a delivery rider but also a loving father of two and a leader in a local charity.

Let's look at how he has adapted to his work. Being a delivery rider requires skills many of us take for granted. You need to use a phone for navigation, handle food orders, and ride safely. Without hands, Li Xiangyang has developed his own brilliant methods. He has fixed his phone to what remains of his arm with a special magnetic mount. We can see his cleverness in every little detail. He straps on knee pads for safety and secures a big black delivery box. When he picks up an order, he asks the restaurant staff to help hand him the food, and then he's off! He has said, "The unicycle basically meets my needs." And get this – he has set a personal record of delivering five orders in a single trip! That's like balancing five big books on your back while riding a unicycle. It's an incredible display of balance and *determination* (strong will / resolve).

Learning these skills hasn't been easy. He has spent years practicing. The journey began when he was about five or six years old. He has told people that simple tasks, like learning to hold chopsticks or a spoon with his foot, took him months and months of practice. It's hard to feel how difficult that must have been. By the time he was a teenager, he had learned how to take care of himself, using his feet to eat and get dressed. The biggest difficulty, he has shared, was not physical but psychological. He has felt fear about the future, worrying about finding work and starting a family. That fear has pushed him to try even harder.

For years, Li Xiangyang and his wife, whom he married in 2016, have relied on the income from his street stall. There, he does something amazing: he writes beautiful characters with his feet, a form of calligraphy. However, the money from the stall was often *unpredictable* (uncertain / variable), changing with the weather or the number of tourists. So, this past July, he decided to become a food delivery rider to earn a more stable income.

His first month was tough. He said, "At first I carried deliveries by hand, but my stumps would get sore, which limited how many orders I could take." But he didn't give up. He has since perfected his method. Now, he works hard all day, spending his mornings delivering meals and his evenings at his calligraphy stall, often working until 11 pm. In just over a month, he has earned nearly 2,000 yuan, which is about 280 US dollars. To put that into perspective, that's enough money to buy about 400 school notebooks! He earns this for his family, saying, "Only by earning my own living can I gain confidence and dignity."

What's truly wonderful is how his work connects him with people. He has said that customers are often surprised when he arrives at their door. They frequently offer him words of *encouragement* (support / praise). This job has given him more than just money; it has given him moral support. He also hopes his story can inspire other people with disabilities to be more active in the community.

This desire to help others comes from his own experiences. He has received kindness from many people throughout his life, and he has never forgotten it. He remembers a noodle vendor who gave him food when he was a child and taxi drivers who gave him free rides. He also remembers how local officials helped his family get a safe apartment when their old one became *dilapidated* (run-down / in bad condition).

These acts of kindness have inspired him to give back. In 2016, he joined a public service group called the Shannabian public welfare association. Over the past decade, he has gone from being a regular volunteer to the organization's leader. Now, he visits schools to give motivational talks and teaches students about calligraphy. He has become a beacon of hope, providing counseling and services to others with disabilities. He has transformed his personal struggles into a powerful force for good. He feels grateful to society and is confident he can take care of his family.

Li Xiangyang’s story has shown us that the human spirit is incredibly strong. He has faced unimaginable difficulties but has responded with creativity, hard work, and a deep desire to help others.

So, here’s a question for all of us: Li Xiangyang has shown incredible strength by turning his challenges into his greatest assets. If you faced a huge challenge, what inner power or unique skill would you find to help you succeed?

That's all for today's special report. See you next time on News Discovery Time!

  News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索……

**(音效: Bang! Pop! Wow!)**

……一个关于非凡力量、智慧变通和一颗充满善良内心的故事！

各位同学，大家好！欢迎回到我们的新闻快报！今天，我们有一则非常特别的专题报道，这个故事真的深深地鼓舞了我们整个团队。故事的主人公是一位克服了惊人挑战、成为社区英雄的榜样。

请大家先想象一下这个场景。你正站在中国湖南省一个著名的旅游景点——凤凰古城的狭窄又热闹的小巷里。你能听到人们聊天的声音，闻到各种街头小吃的香味。突然，你看到一位外卖小哥，熟练地骑着一辆独轮电动车，在人群中灵活穿梭。看起来是不是很酷？但是，当你走近一看，你会发现一个真正令人惊叹的景象：这位外卖小哥，竟然没有双臂。

这就是李向(xiàng)阳(yáng)的故事。他出生于1995年，从很小的时候起，就面临着巨大的挑战。在他仅仅四岁时，一场可怕的漏电变压器事故，永远地改变了他的人生。但是，他被这个困难打倒了吗？完全没有！今天，他不仅是一名外卖员，更是一位拥有两个孩子的慈爱父亲，以及一个本地公益组织的负责人。

让我们来看看他是如何巧妙地适应工作的。当一名外卖员需要很多我们觉得理所当然的技能。你需要用手机导航，处理订单，还要安全地骑行。没有双手，李向阳发明了他自己的一套高招。他用一个特制的磁吸支架，把手机固定在自己的手臂残肢上。我们能从每个小细节里，看到他的聪明才智。他会戴上护膝保护自己，再背上一个大大的黑色外卖箱。取餐的时候，他会请餐厅的店员帮忙把餐递给他，然后就立刻出发了！他说过：“这辆独轮车基本上满足了我的需求。”而且你猜怎么着——他创下了一次最多送五单的个人记录！这简直就像是骑着独轮车，同时还要在背上平衡五本厚厚的书，简直不要太厉害！这展现了他惊人的平衡能力和决心。

学会这些技能可真不容易。他为此付出了很多年的练习。这段旅程在他五、六岁的时候就开始了。他曾告诉别人，像用脚拿筷子或勺子这样简单的动作，他都花了足足好几个月的时间去练习。我们很难体会那该有多么艰难。到他十几岁的时候，他已经学会了照顾自己，用脚吃饭、穿衣。他分享说，最大的困难其实不是身体上的，而是心理上的。他曾对未来感到恐惧，担心找不到工作，也担心没法组建家庭。但正是这份恐惧，激励着他更加拼命地向前冲。

从2016年结婚后，李向阳和他的妻子多年来主要依靠他在街边摆摊的收入生活。他在摊位上做的事情非常了不起：用脚写出漂亮的书法字。然而，摆摊的收入很不稳定，会因为天气或者游客数量的变化而变化。所以，在今年七月，为了获得一份更稳定的收入，他决定成为一名外卖骑手。

第一个月的工作很辛苦。他说：“一开始我用手臂残肢夹着外卖，它们会磨得很疼，这样我就没法接很多单。”但他没有放弃。从那以后，他不断完善自己的方法。现在，他整天辛勤工作，上午送外卖，晚上继续摆地摊写字，常常一直忙到晚上11点。在一个多月的时间里，他赚了将近2000元人民币。给大家一个概念，这笔钱差不多可以买100杯我们爱喝的奶茶了！他为家庭挣得这一切，他说：“只有自食其力，我才能获得自信和尊严。”

最暖心的是，这份工作让他和人们紧密地联系在了一起。他说，当他把外卖送到顾客家门口时，顾客们常常感到非常惊讶，并且会说很多鼓励他的话。这份工作带给他的不仅是金钱，更是精神上的支持。他也希望自己的故事能够激励其他残疾人朋友，让他们也愿意走出家门，更多地参与社会活动。

这种乐于助人的想法，源于他自己的亲身经历。在他的人生中，他得到了许多人的善意帮助，他一直没有忘记。他记得小时候一位面店老板会免费给他东西吃，还记得在他学会骑独轮车前，很多出租车司机会免去他的车费。他还记得，当他们家租的房子变得破旧（dī-pò）不堪时，是当地的政府工作人员帮助他们家申请到了一套安全的公寓。

这些善举激励着他去回报社会。2016年，他加入了名为“善那边”的公益协会。在过去的十年里，他从一名普通志愿者，成长为了这个组织的负责人。现在，他会去学校做励志演讲，教学生们写书法。他为那些有残疾的人提供心理咨询和服务，成为了希望的象征。他把自己经历的挣扎，转化成了一股强大的、能做好事的力量。他由衷地感谢社会，也对自己能够照顾好家庭充满信心。

李向阳的故事告诉我们，人的精神力量是何等强大。他曾面对难以想象的困难，却用创造力、努力和一颗帮助他人的心，做出了最好的回应。

那么，这里有一个问题要问问我们大家：李向阳通过把挑战变成自己最大的财富，展现了非凡的力量。如果你面临一个巨大的挑战，你会发掘自己内心的何种力量或独特技能，来帮助你取得成功呢？

以上就是今天特别报道的全部内容。我们下期“News Discovery Time”再见！
