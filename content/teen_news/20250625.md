News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore some amazing stories from across the world!

Bang! Pop! Wow!

First, we have heard about a very famous tiger in India who loved to hunt crocodiles! This shows the wild power of nature. Next, we will see how young people are getting ready for exciting jobs in technology! It’s time to discover!

Let's start with our wild news from India, in Asia. We have seen stories about a special tiger called "Arrowhead". She lived in a big park called Ranthambore National Park. Arrowhead was very famous because she was super brave and liked to hunt giant crocodiles! Imagine you are quietly walking in a sunny, green jungle in India. You see tall trees and maybe some colourful birds. Suddenly, you hear a splash near a lake! Is it a big fish? A bird landing? No! It's Arrowhead, using her powerful paws to catch a crocodile! Wow!

This brave tiger lived for 11 years. That's like living through **all of primary school and maybe half of middle school** for a human! She was part of a family of famous hunters; her mother and grandmother were also known for catching these big reptiles. Arrowhead herself had four groups of baby tigers, called litters. Even when she was getting older and felt a little weak or `frail` (weak), she still hunted many big crocodiles. It was like she was playing a game of tag with creatures that were maybe as long as **a small school bus**! Her unique arrow-shaped stripes on her face helped people spot her and gave her her name. People from many places, including far away like Europe, have heard about her amazing hunting skills. They `mourned` (felt sad about) her when she recently passed away because of sickness. It was sad to see such a strong and beautiful animal struggling at the end. But her story reminds us how wild and amazing animals can be.

It makes you think about how different animals live and survive in the wild. If you could be any jungle animal, which one would you choose and why? What special skill would you want?

Now, let's travel to the world of technology and learning, mainly in Asia! We have seen some really cool ways that young people are getting ready for jobs in the future. Schools and companies are working together, which is called `collaboration` (working together). They are making special classes just for students to learn skills that companies need. Imagine you are in a special classroom that looks like a real company lab! You can see machines, computers, and tools that people use in actual tech jobs. These classes are `tailored` (made for) the students, and people who work at the companies often come to teach, sharing their real-world experience.

For example, at one school in Inner Mongolia, students are learning how to work with big tech companies like Huawei and JD.com. They get to work on projects that are like real projects from the companies! This helps them get `hands-on experience` (practical doing) and become good at `problem-solving` (finding solutions). Another school in Southwest China, Southwest Petroleum University, works with a solar energy company. Guess what? They built a solar power station right on the school roof! It's a 200-kilowatt station, big enough to power **maybe 100 homes**! Students can see and touch the equipment and learn how it all works by using real information from the station. This is called `immersive learning` (deep learning by experiencing). It helps students feel what it's like to work in the industry before they even graduate.

These special programs are helping students get ready for jobs. At one school, out of all the students who finished these classes, nearly **all** of them found jobs right after graduating! That's like having only **2 people out of 100** *not* get a job! It links learning directly to getting a job in a very smooth way. Young people are feeling more confident about their future because they are learning the exact skills that companies are looking for. They are seeing and touching the technology they will work with. It's truly preparing them for fantastic future careers!

Technology is changing so fast! What kind of technology are you most excited about? If you could invent a robot to help you, what would it do? Think about it!

That’s all for today’s News Discovery Time! See you next time for more exciting stories!

新闻大发现时间到！今天，我们要超给力地探索全球一些超棒的新闻！

砰！嘭！哇！

首先，我们听说了一只住在印度、特别爱抓鳄鱼的有名老虎！这故事展示了大自然狂野的力量。接着，我们要看看咱们的年轻小伙伴们正在怎样努力，为未来精彩的科技工作做准备！探险时刻到了！

咱们先从亚洲印度那边传来的野生动物新闻说起吧。我们看到了一些关于一只名叫“箭头”的特别老虎的故事。它住在一个很大的公园里，叫伦滕波尔国家公园。箭头老虎为什么这么有名呢？因为它超级勇敢，喜欢抓那些巨大的鳄鱼！想象一下，你正悄悄地走在印度阳光灿烂的绿色丛林里，看见高高的树木，还有可能看到五颜六色的鸟儿。突然，湖边传来“扑通”一声响！是大鱼吗？还是鸟儿落在水里？不是！是箭头老虎，它正用强壮的爪子抓鳄鱼呢！太厉害了吧！

这只勇敢的老虎活了11岁。对人类来说，这就相当于从**小学一年级读到中学一年级**那么长的时间！它来自一个有名的猎手家族；它的妈妈和奶奶也因为捕猎这些大爬行动物而闻名。箭头老虎自己生过四窝小老虎。即使它年纪大了，身体有点虚弱，它还是抓了很多大鳄鱼。这就好像在跟那些可能跟**一辆小校车那么长**的家伙玩捉迷藏一样！它脸上独有的箭头形条纹让大家很容易认出它，也因此有了这个名字。包括欧洲等很远的地方，很多人都听说过它超棒的捕猎本领。它最近因为生病去世了，大家都很替它感到难过。看到这样一只强壮又美丽的老虎在最后的时候那么辛苦，简直让人心痛不已。但它的故事提醒我们，野生动物是多么神奇和了不起！

这个故事是不是让你开始想，不同的动物在大自然里是怎么生活和生存的？如果能变成一种丛林动物，你会选哪种，为什么？你想要什么特别的本领？快来告诉我呀！

接下来，我们一起走进科技和学习的世界，主要是在亚洲！我们看到了一些超酷的方式，帮助年轻人为未来的工作做好准备。学校和公司正一起努力，这叫做`合作`。他们专门为学生开设特别课程，教大家公司需要的那些本领。想象一下，你坐在一个特别教室里，它看起来就像公司里真实的实验室！你能看到机器、电脑和工具，这些都是大家在科技工作里会用到的。这些课程都是给学生`量身定制`的，而且公司里工作的人也会来教课，分享他们真实的工作经验，简直不要太棒！

比如，在内蒙古的一所学校，学生们正在学习怎么跟华为、京东这样的大科技公司合作。他们做的项目就像公司里真实的项目一样！这让他们能`亲手实践`（自己动手做），变得更会`解决问题`（找到办法）。在中国西南的另一所学校，西南石油大学，他们跟一家太阳能公司合作。猜猜怎么着？他们在学校的屋顶上建了一个太阳能电站！这个电站有200千瓦，大得能给**差不多100个家庭**供电呢！学生们能看到摸到那些设备，还能用电站里真实的数据来学习它是怎么工作的。这叫`沉浸式学习`（身临其境地学习）。这能帮助学生们在还没毕业前，就感受到在这些行业工作是什么样的。

这些特别的项目正帮着学生们为找工作做准备。在一所学校，所有参加完这些特别课程的学生里，几乎**所有**人都在毕业后马上找到了工作！这简直就像每**100个人里只有2个**没找到工作一样厉害！它把学习和找工作超顺畅地连接起来了。年轻人对自己的未来更有信心了，因为他们学的正是公司需要的本领。他们能亲眼看到、亲手摸到以后要工作的那些科技设备。这真的让他们为未来超棒的职业生涯做好了准备！

科技发展得太快了！你对哪种科技最好奇？如果可以发明一个帮你忙的机器人，你希望它做些什么呢？快发挥你的想象力吧！

今天的《新闻大发现》时间就到这里啦！咱们下期再见，一起探索更多精彩故事！
