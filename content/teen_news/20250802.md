"News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore..."
Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello, super explorers, and welcome back to our news roundup! I'm your host, bringing you the most amazing stories from around our incredible planet.

**(Story 1: Nature's Mysterious Music)**

First up, we dive deep into the ocean. Scientists have recently discovered something truly magical. The beautiful, looping songs of Humpback whales, famous in the Pacific Ocean near Japan, have now been heard for the first time all the way in the Atlantic Ocean, near Iceland! These wonderful whale whispers have crossed thousands of kilometers of water. It's like hearing your favorite song suddenly playing on a radio station on a different continent!

These songs are not simple sounds; they are complex patterns that can last for hours. Researchers believe each population of whales has its own `unique/special` song, which changes a little bit every year. How have these songs traveled so far? Scientists are investigating if some adventurous whales have found new sea routes between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, possibly because of changes in sea ice.

**A. Core Data Visualization:** A single Humpback whale's song can travel over 1,600 kilometers through water. That's about the same distance as flying from London to Rome! It's powerful enough to cross entire seas.

**B. Immersive Scene:** Imagine you are in a small submarine, floating deep under the sea. It's dark and peaceful. All you can hear is the soft hum of your sub. Suddenly, you feel a low vibration, and then you hear it: a long, mysterious, and beautiful call. Eoooo-ahhhh-weeee. It feels like the whole ocean is singing a secret lullaby just for you. That is the song of the Humpback whale.

**C. Open-ended Question:** These songs are a form of communication. If you could send a message with a whale's song that the whole world could hear, what would you say?

**(Story 2: Kids Creating Worlds with AI)**

Next, we blast off into the world of technology! You have probably heard about AI, or Artificial Intelligence. A famous research lab called OpenAI (Open Artificial Intelligence) has created a tool named Sora. This tool can `generate/create` amazing, realistic videos just from a few words of text. For a long time, only experts have used this. But now, that’s changing!

A new global competition called "Kids Create AI" has been launched, giving students from different countries early access to a safe, kid-friendly version of this technology. Children are using it to bring their wildest dreams to life! For example, a team of 11-year-olds from Canada have already made a stunning short film about a brave squirrel climbing the Eiffel Tower to have a picnic. They just typed the idea, and the AI built the video for them to see! These creative kids create cool clips every day.

**A. Core Data Visualization:** To learn how to make these videos, the AI has watched millions of hours of video content. If you tried to watch that much video, it would take you over 3,400 years without any breaks! That's like watching videos since the time of the ancient Egyptians until today.

**B. Immersive Scene:** Picture this: you're sitting with your tablet. You have a fantastic story in your head about a friendly robot playing basketball on Mars. You type: "A shiny, happy robot dribbles a basketball on the red sand of Mars, then does a super slam dunk through a hoop made of asteroids." You press enter, and you feel a buzz of excitement as the screen lights up. You see your robot, you see the red planet, and you see the amazing dunk, exactly as you imagined it.

**C. Open-ended Question:** This technology is becoming more common. If you had access to this AI video tool right now, what is the very first story you would tell?

**(Story 3: Building Dreams with Bricks)**

For our final story, we are getting hands-on with some culture and art! A massive international `exhibition/show` called "Brick World Masters" is currently touring the globe, with recent stops in Australia and Denmark. This isn't just about small models; artists are using millions of LEGO bricks to build gigantic and breathtaking sculptures. We have seen artists construct everything from a life-sized elephant to a detailed replica of the Great Wall of China.

The event celebrates how simple plastic bricks can become powerful tools for storytelling. Brilliant brick builders have worked for months on their projects. One popular piece is a huge, colorful dragon that looks like it's flying right out of the wall. Visitors can see the incredible detail and even hear the roar of the dragon through hidden speakers. This event has inspired many schools to start their own building clubs, encouraging students to work together on big projects.

**A. Core Data Visualization:** One of the most incredible creations, a fantasy castle, used over 2.5 million LEGO bricks. If you were to stack all those bricks one on top of the other, the tower would be over 24 kilometers high. That’s tall enough to reach the stratosphere, where high-altitude jets fly!

**B. Immersive Scene:** Imagine you are standing in a giant room. Instead of paint and clay, the room is filled with endless bins of colorful LEGO bricks of every shape and size. You can feel the satisfying *click-clack* sound as you dig your hands in. The air smells like fresh plastic and pure possibility. You grab a handful of blue bricks to start building an ocean, then some white bricks for the foamy waves. The only limit is your imagination.

**C. Open-ended Question and Activity:** The artists say every brick tells a part of the story. If you had an unlimited supply of bricks, what amazing thing would you build to tell your own story? For a fun challenge, why not grab any building blocks you have at home and try to create something that represents your favorite memory?

That's all the time we have for today. Keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep being awesome. See you next time!

“新闻大发现时间！今天我们要猛烈探索……”
砰！啪！哇！

你好啊，超级探险家们，欢迎回到我们的新闻快报！我是你们的主持人，为你们带来咱们这个奇妙星球上最惊人的故事。

**(第一条：大自然的神秘音乐)**

首先，咱们要潜入深深的海洋。科学家们最近发现了一件真正神奇的事情。座头鲸那优美、循环播放的歌声，本来在日本附近的太平洋里很出名，但现在，竟然一路漂洋过海，首次在冰岛附近的大西洋里被听到了！这些奇妙的鲸鱼“悄悄话”穿越了数千公里的海水。这感觉，简直就像你最喜欢的歌，突然在另一个大洲的电台里响起来一样！

这些歌声可不是简单的声音哦，它们是能持续好几个小时的复杂旋律。研究人员认为，每一个鲸鱼群都有自己`独一无二的/特别的`歌曲，而且每年还会有一点点变化。那它们的歌声是怎么传那么远的呢？科学家们正在调查，是不是有些爱冒险的鲸鱼找到了连接太平洋和大西洋的新航道，这可能和海冰的变化有关系。

**A. 核心数据可视化：** 一头座头鲸的歌声能在水下传播超过1600公里。这差不多是从北京到上海的直线距离！它的力量强大到可以穿越整个海域。

**B. 沉浸式场景设定：** 想象一下，你正坐在一艘小小的潜水艇里，在幽深的海底漂浮。四周又黑又安静，你只能听到潜艇发出的嗡嗡声。突然，你感觉到一阵低沉的震动，然后你听见了：一个悠长、神秘又优美的呼唤声。呜——啊——喂——。你感觉整个海洋都在为你唱一首秘密的摇篮曲。这就是座头鲸的歌声啦！

**C. 开放式追问：** 这些歌声是一种交流方式。如果你能用鲸鱼的歌声传递一个信息，让全世界都能听到，你会想说什么呢？

**(第二条：孩子们用AI创造世界)**

接下来，我们飞速冲进科技的世界！你可能听说过AI，也就是人工智能。一个著名的研究实验室叫做OpenAI（开放人工智能实验室），它创造了一个名叫Sora的工具。这个工具只需要你输入几个词，就能`生成/创造`出超级棒、看起来跟真的一样的视频。在很长一段时间里，只有专家们才能用它。但是现在，情况变了！

一项名为“儿童AI创造”的全球新比赛已经启动，让不同国家的学生们能提前用上一个安全、适合儿童的简化版本。孩子们正用它把他们最狂野的梦想变成现实！比如说，一个由加拿大11岁孩子们组成的小队，已经制作出一部超赞的短片，内容是一只勇敢的松鼠爬上埃菲尔铁塔去野餐。他们只是把想法打出来，AI就帮他们把视频做出来了，简直不要太厉害！

**A. 核心数据可视化：** 为了学会制作视频，这个AI观看了数百万小时的视频内容。如果你想看那么长时间的视频，不休息地看都需要3400多年！这就像是从古埃及时代一直看到今天一样久。

**B. 沉浸式场景设定：** 你来想一下这个画面：你正拿着平板电脑。你的脑子里有一个超棒的故事，是关于一个友好的机器人在火星上打篮球。你输入：“一个闪亮的、快乐的机器人在火星的红色沙地上运着篮球，然后跳起来，用一个超帅的姿势把球扣进了小行星做的篮筐里。”你按下确定键，兴奋地感到屏幕亮了起来。你看到了你的机器人，看到了红色的星球，还看到了那个精彩的扣篮，跟你想的完全一样！

**C. 开放式追问：** 这项技术正变得越来越普遍。如果现在就给你这个AI视频工具，你第一个想讲述的故事是什么呢？

**(第三条：用积木搭建梦想)**

最后一条新闻，我们来亲自动动手，感受一下文化和艺术！一个名为“积木世界大师”的大型国际`展览/展会`正在全球巡回，最近刚在澳大利亚和丹麦展出过。这可不只是搭些小模型，艺术家们用几百万块乐高积木，搭建出了巨大又震撼的雕塑。我们已经看到艺术家们拼出了一头和真实大象一样大的积木象，还有一个由中国团队搭建的、细节满满的积木长城。

这个活动旨在展示，简单的塑料积木如何能成为讲述故事的强大工具。杰出的积木搭建师们为了他们的作品，都花了好几个月的时间。其中一件很受欢迎的作品是一条巨大的彩色巨龙，看起来就像是从墙里飞出来一样。游客们能看到那惊人的细节，甚至能通过藏起来的喇叭听到巨龙的咆哮声。这个活动也激励了好多学校开办自己的积木社团，鼓励同学们一起合作完成大项目。

**A. 核心数据可视化：** 其中最不可思议的一个作品，一座幻想城堡，用了超过250万块乐高积木。如果你把这些积木一块一块叠起来，这个塔会有24公里高。这可就厉害了，高得足以到达平流层，也就是高空喷气式飞机飞行的高度！

**B. 沉浸式场景设定：** 想象你正站在一个巨大的房间里。这里没有颜料和陶土，而是装满了数不清的、五颜六色的、各种形状的乐高积木。你把手伸进积木堆里，能感觉到“咔哒咔哒”的悦耳声音。空气里闻起来是新塑料和纯粹可能性的味道。你抓起一把蓝色的积木开始搭建一片海洋，再拿些白色的积木做成泡沫状的浪花。唯一的限制，就是你的想象力。

**C. 开放式追问和动手建议：** 艺术家们说，每一块积木都在讲述故事的一部分。如果你有无限的积木，你会搭建什么惊人的东西来讲述你自己的故事呢？来个有趣的挑战吧，何不拿出你家里的任何积木，试着拼一个能代表你最美妙回忆的东西呢？

我们今天的时间就到这里啦。继续探索，继续提问，继续做最棒的自己。我们下次再见！
