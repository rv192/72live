News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello, super students, and welcome back to our weekly news roundup! I’m your host, bringing you the most exciting stories of the week. Today, we've discovered a special treasure map. It's not a map to gold, but to amazing new worlds hidden in plain sight. This map is a list of books recommended by teachers, and we have selected some incredible adventures from it to share with you!

Our first story is an expedition into the wild heart of nature, all without leaving your chair. We have found that books like "Homeland on the Earth" and "The Elk Drolma" are acting as powerful portals to the great outdoors. These stories, recently highlighted on a top reading list, have invited thousands of young readers to feel the grass between their toes and hear the whispers of the wind. They don't just tell stories; they let you see, hear, and feel the natural world. Imagine the total number of pages in all the nature books on this list. If you stacked them all up, they would probably reach higher than a 10-story building! That's a huge mountain of adventure waiting for you.

Now, let's step into an immersive scene. Close your eyes for a second. Imagine you are standing on a vast, green grassland. You feel the gentle breeze blowing through your hair. You can hear the soft footsteps of a deer in the distance. This is the world that "The Elk Drolma" has created for us. It’s a reminder that we can connect with nature, even through a story. We have learned that these books are more than just entertainment; they help us understand and appreciate our planet. Have you ever felt such a strong connection to a place you've only read about? These books show us that our imagination is the most powerful tool we have to *explore/investigate* the world. So, my open-ended question to you is: If you could write a story about an animal from your hometown, what amazing adventure would it go on?

Next up, we are blasting off from the natural world into the digital universe! Our second story is about a different kind of hero: the geniuses of science and technology. Forget capes and masks for a moment. How about brains and keyboards? A new comic book series, the "Turing Award-winning scientists comic series," has just been featured on a highly recommended list for kids. The Turing Award (often called the 'Nobel Prize of Computing') is a very important prize for computer scientists. This series turns the *brilliant/very clever* minds who have shaped our digital world into comic book heroes! It shows that the people who write code and design computers have had adventures just as exciting as any fictional superhero.

Think about the impact of these scientists. If every line of code written by a Turing Award winner was a single drop of water, they would have created an ocean of technology large enough to sail a massive ship across. That’s gigantic! Let’s set a scene: Picture yourself curled up with one of these comics. The pages are filled with vibrant colors. You see a scientist struggling with a difficult problem, and then suddenly—BAM!—a lightbulb appears over their head. You can almost feel the spark of their great idea. You see their journey, their challenges, and their ultimate success, all in a fun, visual way. This series has proven that learning about complex subjects like computer science can be incredibly fun. It makes you wonder, what will the next big idea be? So here’s a thought: If you could turn any scientist or inventor from history into a comic book character, who would you choose and what would their "science superpower" be?

For our final story, we are becoming time travelers! We don't need a fancy machine, because our time machines are books! Titles like "Chinese Wisdom in Ancient Architecture," "Searching for Dunhuang All Over the World," and "Delicious! Su Dongpo" have been celebrated as gateways to the past. These books don't just tell you facts; they let you experience history firsthand. You can learn how ancient, towering buildings were constructed without a single modern nail, go on a treasure hunt for beautiful art along the Silk Road, or even explore the favorite foods of a famous poet who lived almost a thousand years ago.

Let's do some fun math to visualize this. The poet Su Dongpo lived over 900 years ago. If you wanted to celebrate his legacy by eating one of his favorite meals every single day, you'd be dining on delicious history for years! Now, let’s imagine we are inside the book "Chinese Wisdom in Ancient Architecture." You find yourself standing inside a massive, peaceful temple. You reach out and feel the smooth, *ancient/very old* wooden pillars. You look up and see the complex roof, where pieces of wood lock together in a perfect, strong puzzle. You haven't just read about it; you have felt the genius of its design. These books have helped us all to see that history is not just a list of dates. It's a living, breathing story full of art, food, and amazing people. As a final hands-on suggestion, why not try to build a small structure using blocks, inspired by what you’ve learned? Or perhaps draw a picture of a historical meal you'd love to try. My question for you is: What modern food do you think a time-traveling poet like Su Dongpo would absolutely love?

That's all the time we have for today, explorers! Keep reading, keep questioning, and keep discovering the amazing stories all around you. Until next time!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索... 砰！啪！哇！

各位超级同学们好，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报！我是你的主持人，为你带来本周最激动人心的故事。今天，我们发现了一张特殊的藏宝图。它不是指向黄金，而是指向那些隐藏在我们身边，通往奇妙新世界的大门。这张地图是一份由老师们推荐的书单，我们从中挑选了一些超棒的冒险故事来与你分享！

我们的第一个故事是一场深入自然之心的探险，而且完全不用离开你的椅子哦。我们发现，像《大地上的家乡》和《马鹿卓玛》这样的书，就像是通往户外的强力传送门。这些故事最近在一个顶级阅读榜单上特别亮眼，它们已经邀请了成千上万的小读者，去感受青草划过脚趾，聆听微风的低语。这些书不只是讲故事，它们让你看见、听见、感受到真实的大自然。想象一下，如果把这个书单上所有关于自然的书的页数加起来，然后一页一页叠高，它们可能会超过一栋10层楼高的建筑！简直不要太厉害了！那可是一座等待着你去攀登的冒险大山。

现在，让我们进入一个沉浸式场景。请暂时闭上你的眼睛。想象你正站在一片广阔的绿色草原上。你感觉到温柔的风儿吹拂着你的头发。你能听到远处一只小鹿走过时轻柔的脚步声。这就是《马鹿卓玛》为我们创造的世界。它提醒我们，即使只是通过一个故事，我们也能与大自然紧密相连。我们已经了解到，这些书不仅仅是娱乐，它们帮助我们理解和珍惜我们的地球。你有没有曾经对自己只是在书中读到的地方，产生过如此强烈的情感连接呢？这些书告诉我们，想象力是我们探索世界最强大的工具。所以，我留给你的开放式问题是：如果你能为你家乡的一种动物写一个故事，它会展开一场怎样奇妙的冒险呢？

接下来，我们要从自然世界一跃而起，冲进数字宇宙！我们的第二个故事是关于一种不一样的英雄：他们是科学和技术领域的天才。暂时忘记那些斗篷和面具吧，咱们来聊聊大脑和键盘怎么样？一个全新的漫画系列——“图灵奖获奖科学家漫画系列”，刚刚登上了备受推崇的儿童推荐书单。图灵奖（Turing Award）通常被称为“计算机界的诺贝尔奖”，是给计算机科学家的一个非常重要的奖项。这个系列把那些塑造了我们数字世界的杰出头脑，变成了漫画书里的英雄！它告诉我们，那些编写代码、设计电脑的人，也曾有过和任何虚构的超级英雄一样精彩的历险。

想一想这些科学家的影响力有多大。如果每一位图灵奖得主写下的每一行代码都是一滴水，那么他们创造出的科技海洋，足以让一艘巨轮在上面航行。这简直太庞大了！让我们来设定一个场景：想象你正捧着一本这样的漫画书，看得入了迷。书页上充满了鲜艳的色彩。你看到一位科学家正在为一个难题苦苦思索，然后突然——砰！——他的头顶上出现了一个灯泡。你几乎能感觉到那个伟大想法诞生时的火花。你看到了他们的旅程、他们的挑战，以及他们最终的成功，所有这些都用一种有趣的、可视化的方式呈现出来。这个系列已经证明，学习像计算机科学这样复杂的知识，也可以充满乐趣。这让你不禁会想，下一个伟大的想法会是什么呢？所以，这是一个思考题：如果你可以把历史上任何一位科学家或发明家变成漫画角色，你会选谁？他或她的“科学超能力”又会是什么？

在我们的最后一个故事里，我们将化身时间旅行者！我们不需要花哨的机器，因为我们的时间机器就是书本！像《古建筑里的中国智慧》、《满世界寻找敦煌（Dūnhuáng）》和《好吃！苏东坡（Sū Dōngpō）》这样的书，都被誉为通往过去的大门。这些书不仅告诉你事实，它们让你亲身体验历史。你可以了解到，古代那些高耸的建筑是如何在没有一颗现代钉子的情况下建成的；你可以沿着丝绸之路，来一场寻找美丽艺术的寻宝之旅；你甚至可以探索一位生活在近一千年前的著名诗人最喜爱的美食。

让我们来做一个有趣的数学题，把这个概念形象化。诗人苏东坡生活在900多年前。如果你想通过每天吃一顿他最爱的美食来纪念他，那你将要连续吃上好几年的美味历史大餐！现在，让我们想象自己进入了《古建筑里的中国智慧》这本书。你发现自己正站在一座宏伟而宁静的寺庙里。你伸出手，触摸到光滑、古老的木制柱子。你抬头仰望，看到了复杂的屋顶，那里的木块像一个完美而坚固的巨大拼图一样，紧紧地扣合在一起。你不仅是读到了它，更是感受到了它设计的精妙。这些书帮助我们所有人看到，历史不仅仅是一串日期。它是一个活生生的、充满艺术、美食和了不起人物的故事。最后给一个动手小建议，为什么不试试用积木搭建一个受你所学启发的小建筑呢？或者，画一幅你很想尝一尝的历史美食。我的问题是：你觉得像苏东坡这样的时间旅行诗人，会超级喜欢哪一种现代美食呢？

探险家们，今天的时间就到这里了！请继续阅读，继续提问，继续发现你周围那些精彩的故事。我们下期再会！
