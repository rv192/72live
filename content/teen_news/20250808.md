News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore...

**(Sound effect: Bang! Pop! Wow!)**

Hello, fellow news explorers, and welcome back to our weekly roundup of the most amazing stories from around the globe!

Our first headline gallops in from the vast grasslands of Asia and the conservation centers of Europe. It’s about a fantastic comeback story! Have you ever heard of Przewalski's (Shuh-val-skees) horse? It’s the only truly wild horse left in the world, meaning it has never been tamed by humans. For a long time, these beautiful, sandy-colored horses were endangered (in danger of disappearing/threatened), and they had vanished completely from the wild. But thanks to an amazing international effort that has lasted for decades, they are making a triumphant return!

Scientists have worked hard to breed these horses in special centers in Europe and then reintroduce them to their native homes in China and Mongolia. The project has been a huge success! China's population of Przewalski's horses has recently surpassed 900. That's a huge number! To help you see it, if all these horses lined up nose to tail, the line would stretch for more than 2 kilometers. That’s like running around a standard 400-meter school track five times! These hardy horses have journeyed from breeding centers overseas back to their ancestral lands.

Imagine you are standing on a wide, grassy plain in Xinjiang (Shin-jyahng), a region in Northwest China. You feel a cool breeze on your face. Suddenly, you hear the distant sound of powerful hooves. A whole herd of Przewalski's horses gallops past, their manes flying in the wind. You can see their strong bodies and feel the ground shake slightly. It’s a sight our ancestors saw, and now we can see it again because people from different continents worked together. To continue this success, some horses have even been moved from China to Mongolia, helping the population grow in new areas. This global teamwork shows what we can achieve when we care for our planet's creatures. If you could help bring back an endangered animal, which one would you choose and why?

Next, we blast off into space! China has just hit a major milestone in its dream to send astronauts to the moon. On Wednesday, engineers successfully completed a huge test of their new manned lunar lander. This special spaceship, named Lanyue (Lan-yoo-eh), which means "Embracing the Moon," is designed to carry two astronauts from lunar orbit safely down to the moon's surface and back again. The test was held at a special site that looks like the surface of another planet, and it was a complete success!

Imagine you are an astronaut inside the Lanyue lander. You look out the window, and you see the grey, dusty moon getting closer and closer. You hear the soft hum of the powerful engines working perfectly. Then, you feel a gentle bump as the four landing legs touch down smoothly. You have just landed on the moon! To make sure this is possible, engineers tested everything, including the flight controls and even emergency plans. The lander has engine redundancy (having a backup/spare part), so even if one engine fails, the astronauts can still return safely.

What’s truly amazing is the lander's design. To make it light enough for launch, some of its parts are no thicker than a soda can! The entire vehicle, which has to support life and scientific work, is a marvel of engineering. This success has inspired kids all over the country. In Beijing, a group of students from the 'Little Rockets Club' watched a live broadcast of the test. A 10-year-old member said she felt that she could really become an astronaut one day. Her club is even building a model of the Lanyue for a national science fair. China is aiming to land its astronauts on the moon by 2030, and this successful test brings that incredible goal one giant leap closer. If you were one of the first astronauts to use the Lanyue on the moon, what scientific experiment would you do first?

For our final story, we travel back in time without leaving the present day! We’re heading to Qufu (Choo-foo), the hometown of the great ancient teacher and philosopher Confucius (Con-fyoo-shus). This summer, the city has become a giant, hands-on classroom for students from all over the world, including places like Hong Kong and Russia. Instead of just looking at things in glass cases, these young visitors are getting to touch, feel, and create history.

Imagine you are holding a soft paintbrush. You dip it in dark ink and carefully press a thin sheet of paper onto a stone tablet carved with ancient wisdom. As you gently tap the paper with an ink pad, a 2,500-year-old message appears: "Choose the good and follow it." You can literally see and feel history appearing right under your fingertips! This is an ancient art called stone rubbing, and it’s just one of the many activities available. Students have also learned how ancient Chinese buildings were constructed and have even tried traditional woodworking, fitting tiny wooden pieces together just like ancient builders.

These immersive experiences are incredibly popular. In the first half of this year alone, the number of international tourists visiting Qufu grew by more than 26%! That’s like if our school of 1,000 students suddenly had 260 new friends join from all around the world. The programs are so successful because they make learning fun and *memorable* (unforgettable/lasting). Students aren't just reading about history; they are living it. This hands-on approach helps everyone better understand the valuable lessons from the past. Why not try a simple version at home? You don't need a stone tablet. Just find a leaf with interesting veins, place a piece of paper over it, and rub the side of a crayon over it to create your own beautiful imprint! The students learned the phrase 'choose the good and follow it.' What's a good lesson you have learned recently that you would want to share with others?

That's all the news we have for this week. Stay curious, and keep exploring!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要全力探索……

**(音效: 砰！啪！哇！) **

各位新闻探险家们好，欢迎回到我们每周一次的全球奇闻大搜罗！

我们的第一条头条新闻从亚洲广阔的草原和欧洲的保护中心飞驰而来。这是一个关于王者归来的精彩故事！你听说过普氏野马（Przewalski's horse）吗？它是世界上唯一真正的野马，意思是它从来没有被人类驯服过。在很长一段时间里，这些漂亮的沙色马儿都处在濒危状态，甚至在野外完全消失了。但多亏了一项持续了几十年的了不起的国际合作，它们正在胜利回归！

科学家们努力在欧洲的特别中心里繁殖这些野马，然后把它们放回到位于中国和蒙古的家园。这个项目取得了巨大的成功！最近，中国普氏野马的数量已经突破了900匹。这可是一个超大的数字！为了让你看得更清楚，如果所有这些马儿头尾相连排成一队，队伍的长度会超过2公里。这就像绕着咱们学校400米的操场跑道跑上整整五圈！这些强壮的野马从海外的繁殖中心出发，回到了它们祖先生活的土地。

想象一下，你正站在中国西北部新疆（Xinjiang）的一片宽广草原上。你感觉到凉爽的微风拂过脸庞。突然，你听到远处传来有力的马蹄声。一整群普氏野马飞奔而过，它们的鬃毛在风中飘扬。你能看到它们强健的身体，还能感觉到大地在微微震动。这是我们祖先曾经见过的景象，现在我们也能再次看到，这都是因为来自不同大洲的人们一起努力的结果。为了让成功延续下去，一些野马甚至从中国被转移到了蒙古，帮助种群在新地区发展壮大。这种全球合作简直太酷了，它告诉我们，当我们关心地球上的生物时，我们能取得多么大的成就。如果你可以帮助一种濒危动物回家，你会选择哪一种？为什么呢？

接下来，让我们飞向太空！中国在实现宇航员登月的梦想道路上，刚刚抵达了一个重要的里程碑。就在周三，工程师们成功完成了一次载人月球着陆器的重要测试。这个名叫“揽月”（Lanyue）的特殊飞船，它的任务就是把两名宇航员从月球轨道安全地降落到月球表面，然后再返回。这次测试在一个看起来就像外星地表的特殊场地进行，并且大获成功！

想象一下，你就是一位坐在“揽月”着陆器里的宇航员。你望向窗外，看到灰色、布满尘土的月球越来越近。你听到强大的引擎在完美地发出柔和的嗡嗡声。然后，你感到一阵轻柔的颠簸，四条着陆腿平稳地接触地面。你刚刚成功登陆月球啦！为了确保这一切万无一失，工程师测试了所有系统，包括飞行控制，甚至还有应急预案。着陆器有发动机冗余（redundancy，就是有备用零件的意思），所以即使一台发动机失灵，宇航员们也能安全返回。

这台着陆器的设计简直不要太厉害！为了让它在发射时足够轻，它的一些部件甚至比一个可乐罐的罐壁还要薄！整个飞船既要维持生命，又要支持科学研究，真是一个工程学上的奇迹。这次成功激励了全国各地的孩子们。在北京，一个叫“小火箭俱乐部”的学生社团就观看了测试的直播。一位10岁的成员说，看到着陆器成功运行，让她觉得有一天自己真的能成为一名宇航员。她的俱乐部甚至正在为全国科学竞赛制作一个“揽月”的模型。中国的目标是在2030年前后将宇航员送上月球，而这次成功的测试，让这个不可思议的目标向前迈出了一大步。如果你是第一批驾驶“揽月”在月球上工作的宇航员，你最先想做什么科学实验呢？

最后一条新闻，我们要来一次“穿越时空”的旅行，但完全不用离开现在！我们的目的地是曲阜（Qufu），古代伟大的教育家和思想家孔子（Confucius）的故乡。今年夏天，这座城市变成了一个巨大的动手实践课堂，吸引了来自世界各地的学生，包括香港和俄罗斯等地。这些年轻的访客们不再是隔着玻璃看展品，而是亲手触摸、感受和创造历史。

想象一下，你正拿着一支柔软的毛笔。你把它浸入墨汁，然后小心地将一张薄薄的纸按在一块刻有古人智慧的石碑上。当你用墨包轻轻地在纸上拍打时，一句2500年前的至理名言就出现了：“择其善者而从之。”你简直能亲眼看到、亲手感觉到历史就在你的指尖下显现！这是一种叫做拓印的古老艺术，也只是众多活动中的一项。学生们还学习了中国古代建筑是如何建造的，甚至还尝试了传统木工，像古代工匠一样把小小的木块拼接在一起。

这些让人身临其境的体验项目超级受欢迎。光是今年上半年，来曲阜的国际游客数量就增长了超过26%！这就像是我们学校有1000名学生，然后突然从世界各地来了260位新同学一样。这些项目之所以这么成功，是因为它们让学习变得有趣又难忘。学生们不再只是阅读历史，他们感觉自己穿越了，正在亲身经历历史。这种动手实践的方式帮助每个人更好地理解古人留下的宝贵经验。你也可以在家尝试一个简化版哦！不需要石碑，只要找一片有漂亮纹路的叶子，把纸铺在上面，然后用蜡笔的侧面在纸上摩擦，就能制作出属于你自己的美丽印记！学生们学到了“择其善者而从之”这句话。你最近学到了什么好的道理，想要和大家分享呢？

这就是我们本周的全部新闻。保持好奇，不断探索哦！
