News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索... Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, a truly *ancient* animal adventure! Scientists from China (that's in Asia!) and the United States (over in North America!) have been working together. They've just shared some super interesting news about how dinosaurs started turning into birds a *really* long time ago.

They looked very closely at a **fossil** (化石/very old remains of plants or animals found in rock) of a tiny, ancient bird called **Archaeopteryx** (始祖鸟/An early bird-like dinosaur). Imagine stepping back in time 150 million years! The world looked so different. Picture yourself walking through a **lush** (茂盛的/green and growing well) forest, with giant ferns and strange-looking trees. And maybe, just maybe, you see something small flitting by. That could have been Archaeopteryx!

This fossil is super special because it's really tiny – about the size of a basketball! And it's one of the best ones ever found. Using cool tech like CT scans (like a special X-ray that takes many pictures to make a 3D view), they have looked inside the fossil's head without even touching it!

What did they find? They saw that its head was kind of in-between a dinosaur head and a bird head. It wasn't as stiff as a dinosaur's, but not quite as light and movable as a modern bird's. This shows an important **stage** (阶段/a period or point in a process) in how animals changed over millions of years. They also found signs of soft parts, like foot pads, that looked like modern ground birds. This suggests Archaeopteryx spent time walking on the ground, maybe looking for food, as well as climbing trees. And guess what else? For the first time ever on an Archaeopteryx fossil, they might have found special feathers called tertiary feathers, which help the wing fly better! How neat is that? These small steps helped these animals become the amazing birds we see flying around today.

It's amazing how these findings, from scientists across continents, help us understand Earth's history. If you could see any ancient animal that isn't alive today, which one would it be?

Next, let's travel all the way to China, where something cool is happening with students from Africa! Students from many different countries in Africa have been visiting and studying in China, learning all about farming and modern ways to grow food.

Imagine being a student who has traveled thousands of miles to learn something new that can help your home country! Picture yourself walking through wide, green fields, maybe even driving a big, shiny tractor or flying a drone over the crops! That's what these students have been doing.

There are over 30 students right now, and more than 90 students from about 13 countries have come to study in China over the last seven years. They spend time in Chinese villages, living and working alongside local farmers. They are learning how to make soil better, how to water plants just right, how to use **fertilizer** (肥料/material added to soil to help plants grow) wisely, and how to stop bugs from eating the crops. They've even helped villagers with things like teaching kids English and learning about selling things online using computers and phones!

And it's working! One student took what she learned back to her country and helped local farmers there. By using new methods, their corn harvest became three times bigger! Think about that – growing three times more food! That's like turning a field the size of one basketball court into a field that can grow food for three times as many people! Isn't that incredible? These students are learning skills that can make a real difference in their communities back home.

It's wonderful to see young people helping others and learning new things. What new skill would you like to learn that could help people?

Finally, we have something sparkly and a little bit wild from New Zealand! In a lovely park in a place called **Taupō** (陶波/A town in New Zealand known for its lake), people have just put up a brand new **sculpture** (雕塑/A piece of art made by shaping material) of a dinosaur. But this isn't just any statue – it's a giant, shiny dinosaur made of steel!

Imagine walking into the park, maybe playing on the grass, and suddenly you look up and see a giant, seven-meter-tall dinosaur made of shiny metal, reflecting the sky and the trees! It's as tall as stacking two giraffes on top of each other! The artist, who is from Slovenia, made this amazing piece called "Boom Boom".

Now, this giant dinosaur has got people in Taupō talking! Some people love it. They think it's cool and makes the park more exciting. It's a fun piece of art that makes people think and chat. Others aren't so sure. They've talked about how much it cost – about 100,000 New Zealand dollars – and if that money could have been used for something else in the community.

The artist says he knows his art can cause people to talk, and he thinks that's a good thing! He also explained that the rocks under the dinosaur are inspired by the local area's history, which has volcanoes! And the type of dinosaur, called a sauropod, is one that scientists think *might* have lived in New Zealand millions and millions of years ago, before they all disappeared.

It's interesting how art can make people feel and think differently! What would you create for your local park that would make people happy and maybe start a fun conversation?

Maybe you could draw your own dinosaur, or build one with LEGOs, and imagine it in your favourite park! Art is everywhere!

That's all for today's news discoveries! See you next time!

新闻发现时间到！今天我们要去探索那些令人惊奇的故事！嘭！啪！哇！

首先，我们要进行一场超级古老的动物大冒险！来自中国（在亚洲！）和美国（在北美洲！）的科学家们最近合作得棒极了！他们刚刚分享了一些超级有意思的消息，告诉我们恐龙是怎样在很久很久以前慢慢变成鸟儿的！

他们非常非常仔细地研究了一块小小的古老鸟儿的**化石**（hùa shí/埋在岩石里的古老动植物痕迹或遗体），这种古老的鸟儿叫做**始祖鸟**（shǐ zǔ niǎo/一种像鸟的早期恐龙）。想象一下，穿越回到一亿五千万年前！那时候的世界和现在完全不一样。你呀，就想象自己走在一片绿油油、**郁郁葱葱**（yù yù cōng cōng/草木茂盛的样子）的森林里，旁边是巨大的蕨类植物和长得很奇怪的树。说不定，就在这时候，你看到一个小小、轻快的东西飞过！那可能就是始祖鸟啦！

这块化石特别了不起，因为它非常非常小——差不多就跟一个篮球那么大！而且它是科学家们找到的保存得最好的化石之一。科学家们用了厉害的技术，就像给化石做了一个特殊的“全身检查”（不用碰它！），他们叫做CT扫描，能拍很多照片，做出一个三维的样子！

他们发现了什么呢？他们看到了始祖鸟的头，发现它呀，介于恐龙的头和鸟的头之间。不像恐龙的头那么硬邦邦的，但也不像现代鸟儿的头那样又轻又能动。这说明了动物们在几百万年里是怎样一步一步变化过来的，是进化中很重要的一步！他们还找到了始祖鸟的脚上软组织的样子，看起来跟现代那些喜欢在地上找食物的鸟儿很像。这说明始祖鸟可能既会在地上走来走去，也会爬到树上！你猜怎么着？科学家们还可能在这块始祖鸟化石上第一次发现了叫做三级飞羽的特别羽毛！这种羽毛可以帮助翅膀和身体之间的空隙变得更小，让它们飞得更稳当！是不是超级酷？这些小小的一步一步，才让这些动物变成了我们今天看到这些会飞的鸟儿！

这些来自不同大洲的科学家们的发现，真是太厉害了，帮助我们了解地球的古老历史。如果你可以见到任何一种现在已经没有了的古代动物，你想见哪一种呢？

接下来，咱们一起飘洋过海，去看看在中国发生的一件很棒的事，这件事呀，跟来自非洲的学生们有关！很多来自非洲不同国家的学生们，一直在中国学习，他们学的是怎么种地，怎么用现代化的方法把粮食种得又多又好！

你想象一下，自己是一个学生，飞了好多好远的路，来到一个完全不同的国家，学习新的本领，希望能帮助自己的家乡！再想象一下，你走在宽阔、绿油油的田地里，甚至可能坐上又大又亮的拖拉机，或者用无人机飞过庄稼上空！这些学生们呀，做的就是这些事！

现在呀，有三十多个这样的学生，在过去的七年里，已经有九十多个来自十三个不同国家的学生来到中国学习啦。他们在中国的一些村子里住下来，和当地的农民伯伯阿姨们一起生活，一起干活。他们学习怎么让土地变得更肥沃，怎么给庄稼刚好足够的水，怎么聪明地用肥料，怎么才能不让虫子把庄稼吃掉。他们呀，还帮助村子里的人做别的事情，比如教小朋友们学英语，还有学习怎么用电脑和手机在网上卖东西！

而且，这个学习呀，特别有效果！有一个学生就把她在中国的学习经验带回了自己的国家，帮助那里的农民伯伯。用了新的方法，他们的玉米收成比以前多了一倍还不止！你想想，能种出三倍的粮食！这就像把一块篮球场大的地，变成了能养活三倍人口的地一样！简直不要太厉害！这些学生们学到的本领，真的能让他们的家乡变得更好！

看到这些年轻人努力学习，帮助别人，真的让人很开心。你最想学什么新本领，是那种可以帮助很多人的呢？

最后，我们来看看新西兰的一个闪闪发亮又有点野性的大东西！在新西兰一个叫做**陶波**（Táo bō/新西兰的一个小镇）的美丽公园里，人们刚刚立起来一座全新的恐龙**雕塑**（diāo sù/用材料做出的人物或动物等形状的艺术品）。但这可不是随便一个雕像哦——它是一座巨大、闪亮、用钢铁做成的恐龙！

想象你走进公园，也许正在草地上玩耍，突然你抬头一看，哇！一个巨大的，七米高的钢铁恐龙就立在那里，它闪闪发光，把天空和树木都映在身上！七米高是什么概念？差不多像把两个长颈鹿叠在一起那么高！这位艺术家是从斯洛文尼亚来的，他给这个厉害的作品取名叫“砰砰”。

嘿，这个大恐龙让陶波的人们议论纷纷呢！有的人特别喜欢它。他们觉得这恐龙太酷了，让公园更有趣了。这是一件很好玩的艺术品，让大家看了会想一想，会聊天。但也有的人不太确定。他们说了这雕塑花了不少钱——差不多十几万新西兰元——觉得这笔钱是不是可以用在村子里的其他地方呢？

艺术家说，他知道他的作品会让大家讨论，他觉得这是件好事！他还解释说，恐龙脚下的石头样子，是受到了当地历史的启发，陶波那里呀，有火山！而且，这种恐龙叫做蜥脚类恐龙，科学家们觉得呀，它们可能在很久很久以前，在恐龙都消失之前，真的在新西兰住过呢！

艺术真有意思，能让大家有不同的感觉，有不同的想法！如果让你为家附近的公园设计一个东西，你会设计什么呢？要是一个能让大家看了开心，还能引起大家有趣讨论的东西哦！

也许你可以回家画一个自己的恐龙，或者用乐高积木搭一个，然后想象它就放在你最喜欢的公园里！艺术呀，就在我们身边！

今天的发现新闻时间就到这里啦！我们下次再见！
