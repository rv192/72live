## English Version

News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore three amazing stories from around the world. Get ready for some surprising animal discoveries, incredible technological achievements in China, and an exciting sports victory!

### Story 1: A Cow That Uses Tools!

Imagine you're walking through a peaceful mountain village in Austria. You see a brown cow named Veronika standing near a farm. But wait - something strange is happening! Veronika isn't just eating grass. She's actually using a broom to scratch her back!

This is the first time scientists have ever seen a cow using tools. Veronika is very smart. She uses the brushy end of the broom to scratch her back where it's hard to reach. When she wants to scratch her soft underbelly, she turns the broom around and uses the smooth handle end. That's like using two different tools in one!

Scientists at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna were amazed. Dr. Antonio Osuna-Mascaro said, "We were not expecting cows to be able to use tools. Until now, this has only been consistently reported in chimpanzees."

Chimpanzees are known to be very clever. They use sticks to catch ants and stones to crack open nuts. But cows? No one knew they could be so smart!

**Fun Fact:** Cows have been living with humans for about 10,000 years, but this is the first time anyone has documented a cow using tools!

**Imagine This Scene:** Close your eyes and picture Veronika on a sunny Austrian morning. She's a beautiful Swiss brown cow with soft brown fur. She finds a broom left by the farmer. First, she uses the brushy end to scratch her back - "ahh, that feels good!" Then she carefully turns it around and uses the smooth handle to gently scratch her belly. She looks very satisfied!

**Think About It:** If cows can use tools, what other amazing things might animals be able to do that we haven't discovered yet?

### Story 2: China's Super Electric Car Charging Network

Here's an incredible number: 20,092,000! That's how many electric car charging stations China has now. Can you imagine that many charging points? It's the largest electric vehicle charging network in the whole world!

This achievement was announced by China's National Energy Administration. By the end of December 2025, the number of charging facilities in China had passed 20 million. This is a huge milestone for green transportation and environmental protection.

**Data Visualization:** Let's break down this amazing number:
- 20 million charging stations across China
- That's like having one charging station for every 70 people!
- These stations can charge millions of electric cars every day
- This network helps reduce air pollution and fight climate change

**Imagine This Scene:** Picture a busy street in Shanghai. You see electric cars quietly zooming by. At the corner, there's a row of charging stations. A family parks their electric car, plugs it in, and goes shopping. When they come back, the car is fully charged and ready to go! No gasoline, no pollution, just clean energy.

**Think About It:** With so many electric cars and charging stations, how might this change the way we travel in the future? Will gasoline cars disappear someday?

### Story 3: China's Young Football Heroes Make History!

"The Chinese miracle continues!" That's what people are saying after China's U23 football team made history. On January 20th, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the Chinese team beat Vietnam 3-0 and reached the Asian Cup final for the very first time!

The players showed amazing teamwork and skill. The score was 3-0 - that means China scored three goals and Vietnam didn't score any. The players ran fast, passed the ball perfectly, and celebrated each goal with joy!

This is a big moment for Chinese football. The U23 team is made up of young players under 23 years old. They've worked very hard, training every day to become better. Now their dream has come true - they're in the final!

**Data Visualization:** The Journey to the Final:
- Start: Many teams from across Asia
- Group Stage: China won matches to advance
- Semi-Final: China 3 - 0 Vietnam
- Result: China reaches the Asian Cup Final for the first time!

**Imagine This Scene:** The stadium in Saudi Arabia is filled with cheering fans. The Chinese players are on the field, their hearts beating fast. The referee blows the whistle. The players run, pass, and shoot! Goal! The crowd goes wild! The players hug each other, smiling and waving to the fans. They've made their country proud!

**Think About It:** What does it take to become a champion? Is it just talent, or is hard work even more important?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索来自世界各地的三个精彩故事。准备好迎接令人惊讶的动物发现、中国令人难以置信的技术成就，以及激动人心的体育胜利吧！

### 故事一：会使用工具的牛！

想象一下，你正走在奥地利一个宁静的山村。你看到一头名叫维罗妮卡的棕色牛站在农场附近。等等——发生了什么奇怪的事情！维罗妮卡不仅仅是在吃草。她实际上在使用扫帚给自己挠痒痒！

这是科学家第一次看到牛使用工具。维罗妮卡非常聪明。她用扫帚的刷毛端来挠她够不着的后背。当她想挠柔软的腹部时，她把扫帚掉过来，使用光滑的手柄端。这就像在一个工具里使用两种不同的工具！

维也纳兽医大学的研究人员们感到非常惊讶。安东尼奥·奥苏纳-马斯卡罗博士说："我们没想到牛能够使用工具。直到现在，这种行为只在黑猩猩中被持续观察到。"

黑猩猩以非常聪明而闻名。它们用棍子抓蚂蚁，用石头砸开坚果。但是牛呢？没人知道它们可以这么聪明！

**有趣的事实：** 牛和人类一起生活了大约1万年，但这是第一次有人记录到牛使用工具！

**想象这个场景：** 闭上眼睛，想象维罗妮卡在一个阳光明媚的奥地利早晨。她是一头美丽的瑞士褐牛，有着柔软的棕色皮毛。她发现了农民留下的扫帚。首先，她用刷毛端挠后背——"啊，感觉真舒服！"然后她小心地把扫帚掉过来，用光滑的手柄轻轻挠肚子。她看起来非常满意！

**思考一下：** 如果牛会使用工具，还有什么其他惊人的事情可能是动物能够做到的，但我们还没有发现呢？

### 故事二：中国的超级电动汽车充电网络

这里有一个令人难以置信的数字：20,092,000！这是中国现在拥有的电动汽车充电站数量。你能想象那么多充电点吗？这是全世界最大的电动汽车充电网络！

这一成就由国家能源局宣布。到2025年12月底，中国充电设施的数量已经超过2000万。这是绿色交通和环境保护的一个巨大里程碑。

**数据可视化：** 让我们来分解这个惊人的数字：
- 全中国有2000万个充电站
- 这相当于大约每70人就有一个充电站！
- 这些站点每天可以为数百万辆电动汽车充电
- 这个网络有助于减少空气污染并对抗气候变化

**想象这个场景：** 想象上海一条繁忙的街道。你看到电动汽车安静地飞驰而过。在拐角处，有一排充电站。一家人停好电动汽车，插上电源，然后去购物。当他们回来时，汽车已经充满电，准备出发了！没有汽油，没有污染，只有清洁能源。

**思考一下：** 有这么多电动汽车和充电站，这可能会如何改变我们未来的出行方式？汽油汽车有一天会消失吗？

### 故事三：中国年轻足球英雄创造历史！

"中国神话还在继续！"这是人们在中国U23足球队创造历史后所说的话。1月20日，在沙特阿拉伯吉达，中国队以3-0击败越南，首次闯入亚洲杯决赛！

球员们展现了惊人的团队合作和技巧。比分是3-0——这意味着中国进了三个球，越南没有进球。球员们跑得很快，完美地传球，并快乐地庆祝每一个进球！

这对中国足球来说是一个重要时刻。U23队由23岁以下的年轻球员组成。他们非常努力，每天训练以变得更好。现在他们的梦想成真了——他们进入了决赛！

**数据可视化：** 通往决赛的旅程：
- 起点：来自亚洲各地的许多球队
- 小组赛：中国队赢得比赛晋级
- 半决赛：中国 3 - 0 越南
- 结果：中国队首次进入亚洲杯决赛！

**想象这个场景：** 沙特阿拉伯的体育场里挤满了欢呼的球迷。中国球员在球场上，心跳加速。裁判吹响哨声。球员们奔跑、传球、射门！进球！人群沸腾了！球员们互相拥抱，微笑着向球迷挥手。他们让国家感到骄傲！

**思考一下：** 成为冠军需要什么？仅仅是天赋，还是努力工作更重要？
