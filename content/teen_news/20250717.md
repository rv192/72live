News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore...
Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello, super explorers, and welcome back to our weekly news roundup! I’m your host, Alex, and we have some amazing stories from around the globe. First up, we have a story that glows, literally!

**Mysterious Glowing Mushrooms Light Up Forests Across Continents**

Scientists have recently confirmed a fascinating discovery in two very different parts of the world: South America and Australia. They have found forests that glow in the dark! This is not magic, but a natural wonder caused by a special type of fungi. These busy, glowing beauties are a type of bioluminescent (生物发光的) mushroom, which means they can produce their own light, just like fireflies.

Imagine you are on a night walk deep in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. It’s completely dark, and you can hear the sounds of strange animals. Suddenly, you see a soft, green light ahead. As you get closer, you see that the light is coming from dozens of tiny mushrooms growing on a fallen tree. It’s a truly *spectacular* (壮观的/amazing) sight! Researchers have reported that in one area in Australia’s Daintree National Park, the glowing patch of fungi was enormous. It covered an area as large as 50 school buses parked side by side! We have seen similar things before, but never on such a big scale across two continents at the same time. These discoveries have helped scientists understand how some living things communicate using light.

Scientists are still studying why these mushrooms glow. Is it to attract insects? Or is it to warn other creatures to stay away? We have not found the final answer yet. If you discovered a new glowing mushroom, what cool name would you give it?

**Student-Named "Star Sweeper" Satellite to Clean Up Space**

Our next story takes us from the dark forests to the darkness of space. Have you ever thought about what happens to old satellites and rockets? They become space junk! The area around Earth is getting crowded with this *debris* (碎片/trash), which can be dangerous for new space missions. But now, there’s a new hero on the way, and it has a name chosen by kids just like us!

The ESA (European Space Agency, 欧洲航天局) has just launched a new mission to tackle this problem. They have built a special satellite designed to catch space junk. Picture this: you're sitting in a mission control room, looking at a huge screen showing the Earth. You see a robot arm extend from a satellite and gently grab a piece of floating metal. That's what "Star Sweeper" will do! Its main tool is a giant net, about the size of a professional tennis court, which it will use to capture old, broken satellite parts. The mission has been years in the planning.

And here’s the best part! The name "Star Sweeper" was chosen in a worldwide competition for schools. The winning team is from a middle school in Texas, USA. They said they wanted a name that sounded hopeful and active. Their idea has impressed everyone. It shows that young people are not just watching the future of space exploration; we are actively shaping it! We feel so proud of them. If you could build a robot to help our planet, what would its special job be?

**"Earth Canvas" Project Turns the World into a Giant Art Gallery**

For our final piece of news, let’s talk about art that you can’t hang on a wall. All around the world, a new art movement called the "Earth Canvas" project has inspired people to create amazing art using only natural materials. From beaches in California to parks in Japan, people have created beautiful, *temporary* (暂时的/short-lived) artworks.

The idea is simple: use what you can find in nature. Artists and families are using colorful autumn leaves, smooth river stones, fallen branches, and even flower petals to make their creations. In Japan, one artist and a group of local children used over 10,000 red and yellow leaves to create a picture of a giant dragon. The final artwork was as long as three school classrooms put together! The art only lasts until the wind blows the leaves away or the tide washes the stones back to the sea. This project is inspired by famous artists like Andy Goldsworthy (安迪·高兹沃斯), who has created nature art for many years.

This is something you can try, too! Imagine you're at a park. The ground is your canvas. You can feel the rough bark of twigs and the smoothness of pebbles in your hands. You can arrange them to create a happy face, a star, or your favorite animal. It’s a wonderful way to connect with nature and see the beauty in small things. It reminds us that wonderful things don't always have to last forever to be important. What message would you want to share with the world through your own Earth Art?

That's all the time we have for today. Keep exploring, stay curious, and we'll see you next time on News Discovery Time!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要深入挖掘……
砰！啪！哇！

你好呀，超级探险家们，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报！我是你们的主持人小艾，我们从世界各地搜罗了一些超棒的故事。首先，我们有一个会发光的故事，是真的会发光哦！

**神秘的发光蘑菇点亮了跨越大陆的森林**

科学家们最近在两个相距遥远的地方确认了一项奇妙的发现：南美洲和澳大利亚。他们都发现了会在黑暗中发光的森林！这不是魔法，而是一种自然奇观，是由一种特殊的真菌引起的。这些忙碌的发光小可爱是一种Bioluminescent（生物发光的）蘑菇，意思就是它们能自己制造光，简直就跟萤火虫一样！

想象一下，你在夜晚深入巴西的亚马逊雨林里探险。四周一片漆黑，你还能听到奇怪动物的叫声。突然，你看到前方有一片柔和的绿光。你走近一看，发现光是从一棵倒下的树上长出来的几十个小蘑菇发出的。这景象真是让人叹为观止！研究人员报告说，在澳大利亚丹特里国家公园的一个地方，发光的真菌面积巨大。它覆盖的区域，相当于50辆校车并排停在一起那么大！我们以前也见过类似的发光生物，但从来没有在两个大洲同时出现这么大规模的。这些发现已经帮助科学家们理解了一些生物是如何利用光来交流的。

科学家们还在研究这些蘑菇为什么会发光。是为了吸引昆虫吗？还是为了警告其他生物离远一点？我们还没有找到最终的答案。如果你发现了一种新的发光蘑菇，你会给它取个什么酷炫的名字呢？

**学生命名的“星星清扫工”卫星将清理太空**

我们的下一个故事，将带我们从漆黑的森林飞向漆黑的太空。你有没有想过，那些废弃的卫星和火箭去哪儿了？它们变成了太空垃圾！地球周围的太空，正被这些*debris*（碎片/trash）塞得越来越满，这对新的太空任务来说可太危险了。不过现在，一位新英雄即将登场，而且它的名字还是像我们一样的同学们选出来的哦！

ESA（European Space Agency，欧洲航天局）刚刚启动了一项新任务来解决这个问题。他们已经造好了一颗专门捕捉太空垃圾的特殊卫星。想象这个画面：你正坐在任务控制室里，看着一个显示着地球的巨大屏幕。你看到一颗卫星伸出它的机械臂，轻轻地抓住了一块漂浮的金属。这就是“星星清扫工”要做的工作！它的主要工具是一张巨大的网，差不多有一个专业的网球场那么大，它会用这张网来捕捉那些又旧又坏的卫星零件。这个任务已经计划了好几年了。

最厉害的部分来了！“星星清扫工”这个名字，是在一个面向全世界学校的比赛中选出来的。获胜的队伍来自美国德州的一所中学。他们说，他们想要一个听起来充满希望和活力的名字。他们的想法让所有人都印象深刻。这说明了，我们年轻人不只是在旁观太空探索的未来，我们正在积极地创造它！我们真为他们感到骄傲。如果你可以建造一个机器人来帮助我们的地球，它的特殊工作会是什么呢？

**“地球画布”项目把世界变成一个巨大的美术馆**

我们最后这条新闻，来聊聊一种没法挂在墙上的艺术。在世界各地，一个名为“地球画布”的新艺术项目，已经鼓励了很多人只用大自然的材料来创造神奇的艺术。从加州的沙滩到日本的公园，人们都创作出了美丽又*temporary*（暂时的/short-lived）的艺术品。

这个想法很简单：就用你在大自然里找到的东西。艺术家和普通家庭都在用五颜六色的秋叶、光滑的河边石头、掉落的树枝，甚至是花瓣来进行创作。在日本，一位艺术家和一群当地的小朋友们用了一万多片红色和黄色的叶子，拼出了一幅巨大的龙的图案。这件艺术品最终的长度，有咱们三个教室连起来那么长！这种艺术只能维持到大风把叶子吹走，或者海浪把石头冲回大海。这个项目是受到了像安迪·高兹沃斯（Andy Goldsworthy）这样的著名艺术家的启发，他已经创作了很多年的自然艺术了。

这也是你完全可以尝试的事情！想象一下你在一个公园里。地面就是你的画布。你能感觉到手中树枝粗糙的表皮和鹅卵石的光滑。你可以把它们摆成一个笑脸、一颗星星或者你最喜欢的动物。这是一种与大自然亲近、发现微小事物之美的绝佳方式。这提醒我们，美好的事物不一定要永远存在才重要。你希望通过你自己的大地艺术，和世界分享什么样的信息呢？

今天的时间就到这里啦。继续探索，保持好奇，我们下期“新闻探索时间”再见！
