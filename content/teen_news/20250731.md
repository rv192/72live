"News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore..."
**Bang! Pop! Wow!**

Hello, amazing explorers, and welcome back to our weekly news roundup! I'm your host, ready to share the most fascinating stories happening across our planet. Have you ever seen a picture online that made you laugh out loud? Our first story is all about that, and it connects animals and people from at least two different continents!

**Story 1: The Working Animals Go Viral!**

Recently, a series of pictures has taken the internet by storm. They show animals doing human jobs! The most famous one features a sleepy seal, tucked into a cozy pink blanket, staring at a laptop. It looks like it’s having a tough day at the office! This **hilarious** (/very funny) photo first became popular in Asia and has now spread all over the world, including North America. People have shared it millions of times, adding funny captions like "Me on a Monday morning."

But this isn't just about one silly seal surfing the web. It's part of a bigger trend. On the continent of Australia, people have posted many photos of smiling quokkas that look like they are welcoming tourists. In South America, we have seen pictures of capybaras chilling in hot springs, looking like they are on a fancy vacation. These images have created a global wave of joy. Combined, these animal photos have received over 500 million likes and shares! To give you an idea, if every single like was a tiny star, you could create a brand new galaxy in the night sky. That’s a massive amount of happiness being shared!

Why have these photos become so popular? Experts think it’s because they are relatable. We see our own feelings in these animals – the stress of work, the joy of relaxing. It reminds us that we all share this big, wonderful world.

Now, let's try a little thought experiment. **Imagine you are a nature photographer hiding quietly in the bushes on a beach.** Suddenly, you see a chubby seal waddle out of the water. It yawns, stretches, and plops down right next to an old laptop someone left on the sand. You snap the perfect picture! What funny caption would you write for it? And for our big question today: **If your pet could have a human job, what job would it do and why?**

**Story 2: Kids Take the Helm of a Sunlight-Powered Spaceship!**

Our next story blasts off into space! The `ESA` (European Space Agency, 欧洲太空总署) has successfully launched a revolutionary new satellite. This isn't your average satellite; it doesn't use rocket fuel to move around. Instead, it uses a giant, reflective "solar sail."

How does it work? It's like a sailboat, but for space! The sail catches photons, which are tiny particles of sunlight. This constant stream of light pushes the sail, allowing the satellite to **propel** (/push) itself through space silently and efficiently. This technology has been talked about for years, but this new mission has finally made it a reality. The solar sail itself is incredible. It’s ultra-thin, thinner than a human hair, but when it’s fully unfolded, it’s as big as an Olympic-sized swimming pool! Yet, it’s so lightweight that it could be folded up and squeezed into a regular school backpack.

But here's the coolest part: kids were involved! The ESA hosted an international competition called "Star Sailors," inviting students from all over the world to submit ideas for the mission. A team of middle school students from Japan and the United Kingdom won! Their project, which involves using the satellite's camera to track ocean plastic from space, has been included as a key part of the mission. They have proven that you are never too young to contribute to big science.

Let's do a little visualization. **Imagine you are an astronaut floating weightlessly in the quiet of space.** Suddenly, a huge, shimmering silver sail unfolds right before your eyes. It catches the bright sunlight, glowing like a massive diamond. You can see our beautiful blue Earth spinning peacefully below you. You feel a sense of wonder, knowing that this amazing ship is being guided by light and powered by the ideas of kids just like you.

This amazing project shows us that the future of space exploration is not just in the hands of grown-up scientists. Young, creative minds are already making a huge impact. So, here is a question for you: **If you could send one message or one small object into space on this solar sail satellite, what would it be?**

**Story 3: Building Dreams Brick by Brick!**

For our final piece of news, let's dive into the world of art and creativity. A new type of art **exhibition** (/show) has been travelling the globe, and it's built from something you might have in your own home: `LEGO` (乐高) bricks! An artist named Nathan Sawaya has created a breathtaking show called "The Art of the Brick," featuring sculptures made entirely from these colorful plastic blocks.

He hasn't just built small models. He has created life-sized human figures, giant portraits, and even a 20-foot-long T-Rex skeleton made from over 80,000 bricks! One of his most famous pieces is a yellow man ripping open his chest, with thousands of yellow LEGO bricks spilling out. It's a powerful and surprising piece of art. The entire exhibition uses millions of bricks. To put that in perspective, one of his dinosaur sculptures used over 1 million bricks. If you were to stack all those bricks one on top of the other, the tower would be taller than the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world!

What's truly special about this exhibition is how it inspires everyone. It shows that you can create something amazing from ordinary objects. It encourages us to look at everyday things in a new way and to unleash our own creativity.

Let's try to picture it. **Imagine walking into a massive, quiet gallery. But instead of paintings, everything is made from LEGO bricks.** You see a giant, crashing ocean wave, frozen in time, made from thousands of blue, white, and clear bricks. You can almost feel the spray of the water. Around the corner, you see a red dress that looks like it's made of silk, but it's actually thousands of tiny red bricks perfectly pieced together.

This story comes with a fun, hands-on suggestion. You don't need a million bricks to be an artist. **Why not grab some LEGOs, building blocks, or even recycled materials around your house and try to build something that represents a dream you have?** It could be a spaceship to visit Mars, your dream house, or your favorite animal. The only limit is your imagination! And that leads to our final question: **If you had an unlimited supply of LEGO bricks, what is the very first thing you would build?**

That's all for today's News Discovery Time. Keep exploring, stay curious, and we'll see you next week!

“新闻探索时间！今天我们即将揭秘...”
**砰！啪！哇！**

你好呀，各位了不起的探险家，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报！我是你们的主持人，准备好分享我们这个星球上最奇妙的故事啦。你有没有在网上看过一张让你哈哈大笑的图片？我们的第一个故事就和这个有关，而且它还连接了至少两个大洲的动物和人们哦！

**第一条：上班的动物们火遍全网啦！**

最近，一系列照片像旋风一样席卷了互联网。照片里，动物们竟然在做人类的工作！最出名的一张，是一只昏昏欲睡的海豹，裹在一条舒服的粉色毯子里，直愣愣地盯着一台笔记本电脑。它看起来就像在办公室里度过了辛苦的一天！这张**非常搞笑**(/hilarious)的照片最初在亚洲火起来，现在已经传遍了全世界，包括北美洲。人们分享了这张图几百万次，还配上了好笑的文字，比如“周一早上的我本人”。

但这可不只是一只在网上冲浪的傻傻海豹的故事。这是一个更大的潮流的一部分。在澳大利亚大陆，人们发布了好多面带微笑的短尾矮袋鼠的照片，它们看起来就像是在热情欢迎游客。在南美洲，我们看到了水豚在温泉里放松的照片，那悠闲的样子，简直就像在度一个超豪华的假期。这些图片在全球掀起了一股快乐的浪潮。把它们加起来，这些动物照片已经收到了超过5亿个“赞”和分享！给你个概念，如果每一个“赞”都是一颗小星星，那你完全可以在夜空中创造一个全新的星系。这真是海量的快乐在传递呀！

为什么这些照片这么受欢迎呢？专家们认为，这是因为我们能感同身受。我们从这些动物身上看到了自己的情绪——工作的压力、放松的快乐。这提醒我们，我们都共同生活在这个巨大又美好的世界里。简直不要太暖心了！

现在，我们来做一个小小的思维游戏。**想象一下，你是一个野生动物摄影师，正悄悄地躲在海边的灌木丛里。**突然，你看到一只胖乎乎的海豹一摇一摆地从水里走出来。它打了个哈欠，伸了个懒腰，然后“扑通”一下，正好坐到沙滩上别人留下的一台旧笔记本电脑旁边。你抓拍到了这完美的一瞬间！你会给这张照片配上什么好玩的文字说明呢？然后是我们今天的大问题：**如果你的宠物可以拥有一份人类的工作，它会做什么工作？为什么呢？**

**第二条：孩子们为太阳能飞船掌舵！**

我们的下一个故事将冲向太空！`ESA`（European Space Agency，欧洲太空总署）成功发射了一颗革命性的新卫星。这可不是一颗普通的卫星；它不用火箭燃料来移动。恰恰相反，它用的是一面巨大的、能反光的“太阳帆”。

它是怎么工作的呢？这就像一艘帆船，不过是太空版的！这面帆会捕捉太阳光里的微小粒子——光子。源源不断的光线会推着这面帆，让卫星能够安静又高效地在太空中**推动**(/propel)自己前进。这个技术已经被科学家们讨论了很多年，但这次的新任务终于让它变成了现实。这面太阳帆本身就超厉害的。它超级薄，比人的头发丝还要薄，但当它完全展开时，竟然有一个奥运会标准游泳池那么大！可是呢，它的重量又非常轻，可以被折叠起来，塞进一个普通的书包里。

但最酷的部分来了：这里面还有孩子们的功劳！欧洲太空总署举办了一个叫做“星星水手”的国际比赛，邀请全世界的学生为这次任务提交想法。一个由来自日本和英国的中学生组成的团队赢得了比赛！他们的项目是利用卫星的摄像头从太空追踪海洋里的塑料垃圾，这个项目已经成为任务的一个关键部分。他们证明了，想要为伟大的科学做出贡献，你永远都不会因为年纪太小而不行。简直不要太厉害！

我们来想象一下这个场景。**想象你是一名宇航员，正毫无重力地漂浮在寂静的太空里。**突然，一面巨大的、闪闪发光的银色帆在你眼前展开。它捕捉到明亮的阳光，像一颗巨大的钻石一样闪耀。你还能看到我们美丽的蓝色地球在下方安静地旋转。一种奇妙的感觉油然而生，因为你知道，这艘神奇的飞船正被光芒引导，并被像你一样的孩子们的创意所驱动。

这个超棒的项目告诉我们，太空探索的未来不仅仅掌握在成年科学家手中。年轻、有创造力的头脑已经能产生巨大的影响。所以，这里有个问题要问你：**如果你可以在这艘太阳帆卫星上发送一条信息或者一件小东西到太空，那会是什么呢？**

**第三条：用积木一块一块地搭建梦想！**

我们最后一条新闻，让我们潜入艺术和创造力的世界。一种新型的艺术**展览**(/exhibition)正在全球巡回，而它的材料你家里可能就有：`LEGO`（乐高）积木！一位名叫内森·萨瓦亚的艺术家，创造了一个名为“积木的艺术”的惊人展览，里面的雕塑作品全都是用这些五颜六色的塑料块拼成的。

他可不只是搭了一些小模型哦。他创造了和真人一样大小的人物雕像、巨大的肖像画，甚至还有一条长达6米、用了超过8万块积木拼成的霸王龙骨架！他最著名的作品之一，是一个黄色的积木小人撕开自己的胸膛，成千上万的黄色乐高积木从里面涌出来。这是一件非常有力量、又让人惊讶的艺术品。整个展览用了几百万块积木。给你个更直观的感受，他的一个恐龙雕塑就用掉了超过100万块积木。如果你把这些积木一块一块叠起来，这个积木塔会比世界第一高楼哈利法塔还要高！

这个展览真正特别的地方在于它能启发每一个人。它告诉我们，你可以用最普通的东西创造出最了不起的作品。它鼓励我们用一种全新的方式去看待日常事物，并释放我们自己的创造力。这件事儿可真有意思！

让我们来想象一下。**想象你走进一个巨大而安静的画廊。但这里没有绘画，所有东西都是乐高积木做的。**你看到一个巨大的、正在翻滚的海浪，被定格在了瞬间，它完全是用成千上万块蓝色、白色和透明的积木拼成的。你几乎能感觉到水花溅到脸上的清凉。拐过一个弯，你看到一条红色的连衣裙，看起来像丝绸一样光滑，但实际上它是由数千块微小的红色积木完美地拼接在一起的。

这个故事还附带一个好玩的动手小建议哦。你不需要一百万块积木才能成为艺术家。**为什么不拿起家里的乐高、积木，甚至是回收材料，试着搭建一个能代表你梦想的东西呢？**它可以是去火星的宇宙飞船，你的梦想小屋，或者你最喜欢的动物。唯一的限制就是你的想象力！这就引出了我们最后一个问题：**如果你有无限量的乐高积木，你最想搭建的第一件东西是什么？**

以上就是今天“新闻探索时间”的全部内容。保持探索，保持好奇，我们下周再见！
