## English Version
News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow! ... the secrets inside a shrimp, a super stylish scooter, and the coolest cloth for summer!

First up, a tasty topic that has puzzled many of us. Have you ever looked at a delicious shrimp and seen that dark, thin line running along its back? Many people have wondered what it is. Some even worry it might be something dirty. Well, let's dive into the world of shrimp and solve this mystery together! This black line is commonly called a "shrimp vein," but it's not a vein like the ones in our bodies. It is actually the shrimp's digestive tract. That’s right, it’s the path that food travels through the shrimp. So, the dark stuff inside is basically the shrimp's last meal.

Now, the big question: do we have to remove it? From a safety point of view, cooking the shrimp thoroughly will kill any harmful bacteria, so it’s generally safe to eat. However, sometimes the vein can have a gritty or sandy taste, which might spoil the sweet flavor of the shrimp. That’s why many chefs choose to remove it. Shrimp belong to a huge family of animals called arthropods (animals with external skeletons and jointed legs). This family is enormous! It includes everything from tiny leaf shrimps to big, powerful lobsters and crayfish. To put it in perspective, imagine a single animal family that's so diverse it's like having house cats and giant tigers as very close relatives. That’s how varied the shrimp world is.

Imagine you are a top chef in a busy kitchen. You have a bowl of fresh, pink shrimps in front of you. You pick one up and see that distinct dark line. You know it’s safe to eat, but you want to create the most perfect, delicious dish for your customers. Do you take the extra time to remove the vein from every single shrimp? It's a choice between convenience and perfection. So, what would you do if you were the chef? There's no right or wrong answer, but it's a fun thing to think about next time you see these popular sea creatures.

Our second story zooms into the world of technology and cool design. Have you ever heard of MUJI (a Japanese brand famous for its simple and natural products)? They make everything from pens to furniture. Now, they have teamed up with Honda (a world-famous company that makes cars and motorcycles) to create something new and exciting: an electric scooter named the Su-MS01. This isn't just any scooter; it’s designed with MUJI’s core idea of being "simple, natural, and just right." In a world full of flashy gadgets, the Su-MS01 is all about minimalism and being friendly to our planet.

This special collaboration is a big step for MUJI, as it’s their first time designing a vehicle. They wanted to offer their fans a complete lifestyle, covering "clothing, food, housing, and transportation." The electric scooter is a perfect fit for this, especially as more and more people are choosing green ways to travel. The Su-MS01 is now available in over 70 Honda stores in China. To picture that, imagine having a special store for this cool scooter in nearly every major city in a large country! It shows how popular this idea of simple, eco-friendly travel has become. The leaders of both companies have said that their main goal was to create a safe, fun, and environmentally friendly riding experience for everyone, making low-carbon travel a part of daily life. This amazing *collaboration* (合作/partnership) shows how two different companies can work together to create something beautiful and useful.

Now, let's set a scene. Imagine you are smoothly and silently riding the Su-MS01 on a sunny afternoon. You feel a gentle breeze as you glide through a beautiful city park. You don’t hear a loud engine, only the happy chirping of birds and the rustle of leaves. People see you on this elegantly simple scooter, and it perfectly matches the calm, green surroundings. This is the feeling that MUJI and Honda wanted to create. If you had the chance to design your own electric scooter, what special feature would you add to make it even more fun or better for our Earth?

Finally, let's talk about what to wear when the sun is blazing. What’s the secret to staying cool? The answer might be a special fabric that has been used for thousands of years: linen. Linen comes from a truly amazing plant called flax. The flax plant (or Linum usitatissimum, its scientific name) is an annual plant, which means it completes its life cycle in one year. And it grows incredibly fast! Planted in March or April, it can shoot up to one meter tall in about 100 days. That’s about the height of a seven-year-old child, all in just over three months!

But the flax plant isn't just useful; it's also incredibly beautiful. In June, flax fields burst into bloom. Imagine standing before a vast field that looks like a piece of the sky has fallen to Earth. The flax plant has delicate, sky-blue flowers, tall, graceful stems, and long, thin leaves. It’s a breathtaking sight that many artists have loved to paint. While the most common flax flowers are blue, other species in the flax family can have white, yellow, or even red flowers. This beautiful plant gives us the strong fibers that are woven into linen cloth, famous for feeling cool and comfortable in hot weather. It’s like nature’s own air conditioner! The next time you feel a piece of linen clothing, remember the beautiful, busy blue flax fields swaying in the wind. What other useful things do you think could be made from the strong fibers of the flax plant?

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索……砰！啪！哇！……藏在虾身体里的小秘密、一辆超级有范儿的电动车，还有夏天最凉快的布料！

首先，我们来聊一个好吃又让很多人困惑的话题。你有没有在吃美味的大虾时，看到它背上那条黑黑的细线？很多人都想知道那到底是什么，甚至担心它干不干净。别急，今天我们就一起潜入虾的世界，解开这个谜团！这条黑线通常被称为“虾线”，但它可不是我们身体里的那种血管。它其实是虾的消化道。没错，就是食物在虾身体里走过的通道。所以，里面黑黑的东西，基本上就是虾吃掉的最后一顿饭。

那么，最大的问题来了：我们到底要不要去掉虾线呢？从安全角度说，只要把虾彻底煮熟，就能杀死所有可能存在的细菌，所以吃了也没啥大事。不过呢，有时候虾线里可能会有一些沙子或者没消化完的东西，吃起来口感有点怪，可能会影响虾肉本身的鲜甜味道。这就是为什么很多大厨都选择把它去掉。虾属于一个超级庞大的动物家族，叫做节肢动物（就是有外部骨骼和分节的腿的动物）。这个家族的成员可多了！从超级迷你的叶虾，到威武雄壮的大龙虾和鳌（áo）虾，都算是亲戚。打个比方，这就像一个动物大家族里，既有温顺的小猫，又有威猛的老虎，它们还都是很近的亲戚。虾的世界就是这么丰富多彩！

想象一下，你是一位顶级大厨，正站在繁忙的厨房里。你面前放着一碗新鲜粉嫩的大虾。你拿起一只，看到了背上那条清晰的黑线。你知道它煮熟了吃是安全的，但你想为客人们做出最完美、最美味的菜肴。你会不会花额外的时间，把每一只虾的虾线都去掉呢？这是一个在方便和完美之间的选择。简直让人头大！那么，如果你是这位大厨，你会怎么做呢？

我们的第二条新闻，将飞速驶入科技和酷炫设计的世界。你听说过MUJI（无印良品，一个以“简约自然”出名的日本品牌）吗？他们家的东西从文具到家具，啥都有。现在，他们和Honda（本田，一个生产汽车和摩托车的全球知名公司）联手，创造了一款超酷的新产品：一辆名叫“素-MS01”的电动车。这可不是一辆普通的电动车，它的设计完全体现了MUJI“简单、自然、刚刚好”的理念。在一个充满各种花哨产品的世界里，素-MS01主打的就是简约风格和保护地球。

这次特别的合作对MUJI来说是很大的一步，因为这是他们第一次参与交通工具的设计。他们希望为粉丝们提供一种完整的生活方式，覆盖“衣、食、住、行”的方方面面。电动车就完美符合这个想法，尤其是现在越来越多的人选择绿色的出行方式。目前，素-MS01已经在中国70多家本田店里销售了。这是什么概念呢？相当于在一个大国的几乎每个主要城市，都有一家可以买到这辆酷车的小店！这说明，简单又环保的出行理念已经变得非常流行了。两家公司的负责人都表示，他们的共同目标就是为人们带来安全、环保又有趣的骑行体验，让低碳出行成为我们日常生活的一部分。简直不要太厉害！

现在，让我们进入一个场景。想象一下，在一个阳光明媚的下午，你正安静又平稳地骑着素-MS01。你感觉微风轻轻拂过脸庞，你滑过一座美丽的城市公园。你听不到巨大的引擎声，只能听到小鸟愉快的歌唱和树叶的沙沙声。人们看到你骑着这辆优雅简洁的小车，它和周围宁静、绿色的环境完美地融为一体。这就是MUJI和本田想要创造的感觉。如果你有机会设计自己的电动车，你会给它增加什么特别的功能，让它变得更有趣，或者对地球更友好呢？

最后，我们来聊聊大太阳天该穿什么。怎样才能保持凉爽呢？答案可能藏在一种已经使用了几千年的特殊布料里：亚麻。亚麻来自一种非常神奇的植物，叫做亚麻草。亚麻草（它的学名是Linum usitatissimum）是一年生植物，意思就是它一年内就能完成自己的生命周期。而且它长得飞快！三四月份种下，大约100天后就能长到一米高。这差不多有七岁小朋友那么高了，而它只用了三个多月的时间！

不过，亚麻草不仅有用，还特别漂亮。到了六月，亚麻田就会开满花朵。想象一下，你站在一片广阔的田野前，那景象就好像一块天空掉到了大地上。亚麻草开着淡雅的天蓝色花朵，有着亭亭玉立（tíng tíng yù lì）的茎和纤细的叶子。这幅美景绝对让你终生难忘，很多画家都喜欢描绘它。虽然最常见的亚麻花是蓝色的，但亚麻家族里其他的成员也会开出白色、黄色甚至红色的花。就是这种美丽的植物，为我们提供了坚韧的纤维，这些纤维被织成亚麻布，以其在热天里凉爽舒适而闻名。简直就是大自然自带的空调！下次当你摸到一件亚麻衣服时，记得它背后那片在风中摇曳（yáo yè）的美丽蓝色亚麻田。那画面，别提多美了！你觉得，除了做衣服，亚麻坚韧的纤维还能用来做什么有用的东西呢？
