News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore...
(Sound effect: Bang!) Space Rocks!
(Sound effect: Pop!) Super Homework!
(Sound effect: Wow!) Amazing Ideas!

Hello, awesome explorers, and welcome to our weekly news roundup! We have some incredible stories that have happened all around our world, and even from beyond it!

**(Story 1: A Visitor from the Stars)**

Our first story is a real cosmic crash! We travel first to North America, specifically to the state of Georgia in the United States. Recently, a family got the surprise of their lives when an object from space smashed right through their roof! It wasn't a piece of an airplane or a stray satellite. It was a meteorite, a rock that has traveled through the vast emptiness of space for billions of years.

Imagine you are sitting in your room, maybe reading a book or playing a game. Suddenly, you hear a massive "BOOM!" that shakes the windows. It sounds like thunder, but the sky is perfectly blue. A moment later, you hear a loud "CRACK!" from upstairs. You rush to see what happened and find a hole in your ceiling! On the floor, there is a dark, heavy rock that feels strangely warm. A real visitor from the stars has just dropped into your house!

Scientists from the University of Georgia have studied a *fragment* (a small piece/part) of this rock and they have found something astonishing. This meteorite is a special type called a Chondrite (KON-drite), which is a stony meteorite that hasn't been changed by melting. Because of its composition, they can *determine* (find out/discover) its age. And guess what? This rock is about 4.56 billion years old. Our planet Earth is only about 4.54 billion years old. That means this space rock is 20 million years older than our own world!

How can we visualize that amount of time? Think of it this way: if the entire history of the Earth was squeezed into one single year, with Earth being formed on January 1st, this rock would have been formed in the previous year! It's a true time traveler. When it entered our atmosphere, residents saw a brilliant fireball tearing through the sky. It was traveling at over 1 kilometer per second. That is so fast, it’s like running the length of ten football fields in a single second! That's a speedy space delivery!

This incredible event connects us to the very beginning of our solar system. We have seen how a rock from the asteroid belt, a place far beyond our planet, has made a dramatic journey to land on our continent, North America. It reminds us that the universe is a busy, buzzing place full of wonders. Scientists are excited because studying rocks like this helps them understand how planets, including our own, were formed. So, here's a thought for you: if a small, harmless piece of a meteorite, older than the Earth itself, landed in your backyard, what would you do?

**(Story 2: The Homework Revolution)**

Now, for our second story, we fly across the globe to Asia, to a city called Nanjing in China. When you hear the word "homework," you might think of boring worksheets and long essays. But what if homework could be a grand adventure? At Nanjing Xiaozhuang Primary School (Nanjing Syow-joo-ahng Primary School), teachers have created something amazing called "long-term homework."

This isn't your everyday assignment. It’s a huge, fun project that can last for weeks and *integrates* (combines/mix) many different subjects together. Students aren't just memorizing facts; they are becoming detectives, scientists, and creators.

Let's set the scene. Picture this: your homework is to learn about maltose candy, a traditional sweet treat. But you don't just read about it. First, you join your science class to grow your own wheat sprouts. Then, you head to your labor and skills class, where you feel the sticky texture as you learn to use those sprouts to make the actual candy! In math, you use your delicious creation to learn about weights and units like "grams." You can see the numbers on the scale change as you add more candy. For your language arts class, you write a story about the experience, maybe calling it "My Sweet Sharing Party." And in art class, you draw a colorful poster about how to make it. This is not just homework; it's a *comprehensive* (complete/thorough) learning party!

The school has designed many of these projects. One group of fifth-graders took on a project called "Is the store discount a pie in the sky or a trap?" For three weeks, they acted like real researchers. They made surveys, visited stores, searched for information online, and did the math to figure out if sale prices were really a good deal. They learned math, social studies, and internet research skills all at once. It’s awesome, isn't it?

The power of this idea is connection. Instead of learning five separate things, students see how everything is linked. It's like building a giant LEGO model. Science is one type of brick, math is another, and art is a different color. By themselves, they are just bricks. But when you put them all together following a cool plan, you create something incredible, like a giant castle or a spaceship! These projects have helped students understand their lessons better and made learning way more exciting.

This amazing educational idea shows that learning doesn't have to stay inside the classroom. So, here's an open question for all you creative minds out there: If you could design your own "long-term homework" project, what would it be about? Maybe building a robot, creating a video game, or investigating the history of your favorite food?

And here’s a hands-on suggestion: try a mini-version yourself! Pick something you love, like space. You could draw the planets (art), calculate their distance from the sun (math), write a story about an alien (language arts), and build a model rocket (science and craft). You can start your own homework revolution right at home!

That’s all the time we have for today. Keep your eyes open, stay curious, and we'll see you next time for more amazing discoveries!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索……
（音效：砰！）太空石！
（音效：啪！）超级作业！
（音效：哇！）奇妙点子！

你好，各位了不起的探险家，欢迎收听我们的每周新闻快报！我们有一些超级精彩的故事，它们发生在世界各地，甚至还有来自世界之外的呢！

**（故事一：来自星星的访客）**

我们的第一个故事是一次真正的宇宙撞击！我们首先要飞到北美洲，具体来说是美国的佐治亚州。最近，一户人家收到了他们人生中最大的惊喜，一个从太空来的物体直接砸穿了他们家的屋顶！它不是飞机零件，也不是掉下来的卫星。它是一块陨石，一块在广阔无垠的太空中旅行了数十亿年的石头。

想象一下，你正坐在房间里，可能在看书或者玩游戏。突然，你听到一声巨大的“轰！”，把窗户都震得嗡嗡响。这声音像打雷，但天空却是一片晴朗。过了一会儿，你又听到楼上传来“咔嚓！”一声脆响。你赶紧跑上去看发生了什么，结果发现天花板上有一个洞！地板上，有一块黑乎乎、沉甸甸的石头，摸上去还有点奇怪的温度。一位真正的“天外来客”刚刚空降到你家啦！

佐治亚大学的科学家们研究了这块石头的*碎片*（一小块/一部分），他们有了惊人的发现。这块陨石是一种叫做球粒陨石（Chondrite，发音：KON-drite）的特殊类型，它是一种没有经过融化改变的石质陨石。通过它的成分，科学家们可以*确定*（搞清楚/发现）它的年龄。你猜怎么着？这块石头的年龄大约是45.6亿年。而我们的地球，大约只有45.4亿年的历史。这意味着，这块太空石头比我们自己的家园还要年长2000万年！简直不要太厉害！

我们怎么才能想象这么长的时间呢？这么想吧：如果把地球的全部历史压缩成一年，地球在1月1日形成，那么这块石头就是在前一年就已经存在了！它是一个真正的时间旅行者。当它冲进我们的大气层时，居民们看到了一个耀眼的火球划破天际。它的飞行速度超过每秒1公里。这是什么概念呢，快到就像在一秒钟内跑完十个足球场的长度！这真是一次超高速的太空快递！

这个不可思议的事件把我们和太阳系最初的样子连接了起来。我们看到了，一块来自我们星球之外的小行星带的岩石，如何完成了一次戏剧性的旅程，降落到了我们的北美洲大陆。它提醒我们，宇宙是一个充满奇迹的热闹地方。科学家们可兴奋了，因为研究这样的石头能帮助他们理解包括我们地球在内的行星是如何形成的。那么，问题来了：如果一小块比地球还古老的、没有危险的陨石掉进了你家院子，你会怎么做呢？

**（故事二：作业大变身）**

现在，来看我们的第二个故事，我们要飞越大半个地球来到亚洲，中国的南京市。当你听到“作业”这个词，你可能会想到无聊的练习册和长长的作文。但是，如果作业可以变成一场盛大的冒险呢？在南京市晓庄小学（Nanjing Syow-joo-ahng Primary School），老师们创造了一种超棒的东西，叫做“长程作业”。

这可不是你每天做的普通任务。它是一个巨大的、有趣的、可以持续好几个星期的项目，并且*融合*（结合/混合）了许多不同的学科。学生们不仅仅是在背知识点，他们正在变身为侦探、科学家和创造者。

让我们来描绘一个场景。你想想看：你的作业是学习一种叫麦芽糖的传统甜食。但你不是光读书了解它。首先，你在科学课上亲手培育小麦发芽。然后，你跑到劳动技能课上，感受着那黏黏的触感，学习怎么用这些麦芽来制作真正的糖果！在数学课上，你用自己做好的美味糖果来学习重量和“克”这样的单位。你可以看到，随着你放上更多糖果，秤上的数字也在变化。在语文课上，你把这段经历写成一个故事，或许可以叫它《我的甜蜜分享会》。而在美术课上，你画一张五颜六色的海报，介绍它的制作方法。这已经不只是作业了，简直就是一个*全面的*（完整的/彻底的）学习派对！

学校设计了很多这样的项目。有一组五年级的同学接到了一个叫“商店打折是馅饼还是陷阱？”的项目。在三个星期里，他们就像真正的研究员一样。他们制作调查问卷，去商店实地考察，上网搜集资料，还动手计算，来弄清楚打折价格是不是真的划算。他们一下子就学到了数学、社会知识和网络研究的本领。是不是很赞？

这个点子的力量在于“连接”。学生们不再是学习五个孤立的东西，而是看到了一切事物是如何联系在一起的。这就像搭一个巨大的乐高模型。科学是一种积木，数学是另一种，而艺术是不同颜色的。它们自己本身只是积木。但当你按照一个很酷的计划把它们全都拼在一起时，你就能创造出像巨型城堡或宇宙飞船一样了不起的东西！这些项目帮助学生们更好地理解了课本知识，也让学习变得有趣多了。

这个超棒的教育创意说明，学习不一定非要关在教室里。所以，这里有一个开放式问题，给所有充满创造力的同学们：如果你可以设计自己的“长程作业”，你希望它是什么主题呢？也许是造一个机器人，开发一款电子游戏，或者调查你最喜欢的食物的历史？

这里还有一个动手小建议：你自己也来试试迷你版吧！选一个你超爱的主题，比如太空。你可以画出各个行星（美术），计算它们离太阳有多远（数学），写一个关于外星人的故事（语文），再做一个火箭模型（科学和手工）。你可以在家里就掀起一场自己的作业大变革哦！

今天的时间就到这里了。保持睁大双眼，保持好奇心，我们下一次再见，去发现更多奇妙的事情！
