News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索...
Bang! Pop! Wow!

**Global Warming Creates City Rat Army Across Continents!**

Scientists have discovered something amazing and a bit scary! Global warming has caused rat populations to explode in cities all around the world. From Asia to Europe, North America to Australia, these furry creatures have been multiplying like never before.

Imagine you're walking down a city street at night. You hear rustling (noise/movement) in the garbage cans nearby. Suddenly, you see dozens of beady eyes looking back at you! This scene has become more common in cities worldwide as rats have taken over urban areas.

The rat population has grown so much that if all the rats in major cities stood in a line, they would circle the Earth 1.5 times! That's like having 60,000 football fields filled with rats. Scientists say warmer temperatures have helped rats survive winters and reproduce more babies.

Rats are not just in one country or continent. They have become a global problem, affecting cities in Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia. In some places, people have reported seeing rats as big as small cats!

What can we do about this rat invasion? Some cities are using smart trash cans that rats can't open. Others are bringing in natural predators like owls to help control the rat population. But the real solution might be fighting global warming itself.

If you were a city planner, what would you do to solve this rat problem? Would you create special rat-catching robots? Or maybe design cities that are less friendly to rats? The answer might just be in your hands!

**Super Robot Chip Helps Kids Learn Technology!**

NVIDIA (英伟达/a computer company) has released a new super chip for robots called Jetson Thor. This amazing piece of technology can make robots think and act seven times faster than before! It's like giving robots a super-powered brain.

Imagine you're sitting in a classroom, controlling a robot with just your voice. "Robot, please draw a circle," you say, and the robot immediately picks up a pen and draws a perfect circle on the paper. This is now possible thanks to the new Jetson Thor chip.

The computing power of this chip is so strong that it equals the power of 250 regular laptops working together! That's enough power to run 10,000 video games at the same time without any lag.

What's really exciting is how schools are using this technology. In Beijing, a group of 12-year-old students have built their own robot using this chip. Their robot can help clean the classroom and even answer questions about homework! The students say working with robots has made them more interested in science and technology.

Robotics clubs for children are popping up all over the world. Kids as young as 8 years old are learning to program robots that can dance, play soccer, and even help elderly people with simple tasks.

If you could design your own robot, what would it do? Would it help you with your homework? Clean your room? Or maybe it would be a robot friend who could play games with you? The possibilities are endless with this new technology!

**Ancient Stone Art Comes Alive for Young Artists!**

In China, a 58-year-old artist named Li Yahua is keeping alive an amazing traditional art form called Shadow Carving. This special art involves creating beautiful pictures on stones using tiny metal needles.

Imagine you're holding a special steel needle in your hand. You gently tap it against a black stone, creating tiny dots that form a picture. With thousands of careful taps, you create a detailed image that looks like a photograph! This is how shadow carving works.

Each shadow carving artwork requires about 200,000 tiny taps with the needle. That's like tapping your finger once every second for 55 hours straight! Li Yahua is the 16th generation master of this incredible art form, which comes from the Minnan region in southern China.

Li Yahua's latest work, called "Twelve Beauties," is now on display at the Huihe Stone Culture Park in Xiamen. The artwork shows twelve beautiful women with such detail that you can see the patterns on their clothes and the expressions on their faces.

The best part is that young people can try this art too! You don't need expensive materials to start. All you need is a smooth stone, a nail, and a small hammer. You can start with simple designs like flowers or animals and work your way up to more complex pictures.

Would you like to try shadow carving? What picture would you create on your stone? Maybe a portrait of your pet, or a beautiful landscape, or even your own design! This ancient art form is waiting for young artists like you to discover and continue its tradition.

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索...
砰！啪！哇！

**全球变暖引发城市老鼠大军横跨多洲！**

科学家们发现了一些惊人又有点吓人的事情！全球变暖导致全世界城市中的老鼠数量爆炸式增长。从亚洲到欧洲，从北美到澳大利亚，这些毛茸茸的生物以前所未有的速度繁殖。

想象一下，你正夜晚走在城市街道上。你听到附近的垃圾桶里有沙沙作响的声音。突然，你看到几十双闪亮的小眼睛回望着你！随着老鼠占领城市地区，这样的场景在世界各地的城市变得越来越常见。

老鼠数量增长得如此之多，如果把所有主要城市的老鼠排成一条线，它们可以绕地球1.5圈！这相当于60,000个足球场都装满老鼠。科学家们说，温暖的气温帮助老鼠度过冬天并繁殖更多幼崽。

老鼠不仅仅存在于一个国家或大洲。它们已经成为全球性问题，影响着亚洲、欧洲、北美和澳大利亚的城市。在一些地方，人们报告看到像小猫一样大的老鼠！

我们能对这场老鼠入侵做些什么呢？一些城市正在使用老鼠打不开的智能垃圾桶。另一些城市则引入猫头鹰等自然捕食者来帮助控制老鼠数量。但真正的解决方案可能是对抗全球变暖本身。

如果你是城市规划师，你会如何解决这个老鼠问题？你会制造特殊的捕鼠机器人吗？或者设计对老鼠不太友好的城市？答案可能就在你的手中！

**超级机器人芯片帮助孩子们学习科技！**

英伟达（NVIDIA/一家计算机公司）发布了一款名为Jetson Thor的新型机器人超级芯片。这项惊人的技术可以让机器人的思考和行动速度比以前快7倍！这就像给机器人一个超级动力的大脑。

想象一下，你坐在教室里，只用声音就能控制一个机器人。"机器人，请画一个圆圈，"你说，机器人立即拿起笔在纸上画出一个完美的圆圈。由于新的Jetson Thor芯片，这现在成为可能。

这款芯片的计算能力如此强大，相当于250台普通笔记本电脑同时工作的能力！这足够能同时运行10,000个视频游戏而不会出现任何延迟。

真正令人兴奋的是学校如何使用这项技术。在北京，一群12岁的学生已经使用这款芯片制造了自己的机器人。他们的机器人可以帮助打扫教室，甚至回答关于家庭作业的问题！学生们说，与机器人一起工作让他们对科学技术更感兴趣。

儿童机器人俱乐部正在世界各地如雨后春笋般涌现。年仅8岁的孩子们正在学习编程能跳舞、踢足球甚至帮助老年人完成简单任务的机器人。

如果你能设计自己的机器人，它会做什么？它会帮你做作业吗？打扫你的房间？或者它会是一个能和你一起玩游戏的机器人朋友？有了这项新技术，可能性是无限的！

**古老石艺为年轻艺术家注入活力！**

在中国，58岁的艺术家李亚华正在延续一种名为影雕的惊人传统艺术形式。这种特殊的艺术涉及使用微型金属针在石头上创作美丽的图片。

想象一下，你手中拿着一根特殊的钢针。你轻轻地在黑石上敲击，形成构成图片的小点。通过成千上万次小心翼翼的敲击，你创造出一幅看起来像照片的精细图像！这就是影雕的工作原理。

每件影雕艺术品需要大约20万次用针的轻敲。这相当于连续55秒每秒敲一次手指！李亚华是这种令人难以置信的艺术形式的第16代传承人，这种艺术形式来自中国南部的闽南地区。

李亚华的最新作品《十二美》正在厦门惠和石文化园展出。这件艺术品展示了十二位美丽的女性，细节如此精细，你可以看到她们衣服上的图案和脸上的表情。

最好的部分是年轻人也可以尝试这种艺术！你不需要昂贵的材料就可以开始。你只需要一块光滑的石头、一根钉子和一把小锤子。你可以从简单的设计开始，比如花朵或动物，然后逐步制作更复杂的图片。

你想尝试影雕吗？你会在石头上创作什么图片？也许是你宠物的肖像，或者美丽的风景，甚至是你的原创设计！这种古老的艺术形式正等待着像你这样的年轻艺术家去发现和延续其传统。
