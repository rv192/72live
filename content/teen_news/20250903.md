Meanwhile, in South America, rare pink dolphins have appeared in rivers where they haven't been seen for decades, and in Asia, thousands of fireflies have created spectacular light shows in forests that scientists can't fully explain. These events have left researchers wondering if climate change is causing nature to behave in new ways. If you were a scientist studying these events, what questions would you want to answer first?
