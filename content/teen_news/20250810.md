News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! ...the world's most unique dogs and student superheroes in engineering!

**Story 1: Celebrating Unique Pups at the World's Ugliest Dog Contest**

Have you ever seen a dog so special that it wins a prize for its looks? Well, that is exactly what happens every year in California, USA. A very famous and funny event called the "World's Ugliest Dog" contest has returned, and people love it! This isn't about being mean to dogs; it's a huge party to celebrate dogs that look a little different.

The contest is held at the Sonoma County Fair, and it has attracted hundreds of people. To give you an idea, imagine your entire school assembly, plus maybe two more schools, all gathering in one sunny park. **That's over 1,000 people coming to cheer for these amazing canine companions!** They all come to see the wonderful, weird, and wacky dogs competing for the crown. The main goal of this event is to *promote* (encourage/support) adopting dogs from rescue shelters. It shows that every dog, no matter its age, size, or appearance, deserves a loving home. It's a powerful message that beauty is not just about having perfect fur or a straight tail.

What makes this story a global one? Many of the breeds that participate have roots all over the world. For example, a breed called the Chinese Crested Dog has often won the title. While its modern form was developed in America (North America), historians believe its ancestors came from either Africa or China (Asia). So, you can see these little champions bring a story from different continents right to the stage! These amazing animals are a fantastic furry testament to our planet's diversity.

Let's set the scene. **Imagine you are standing at the fair in sunny California. You can feel the warm sun on your skin and hear the cheerful crowd buzzing with excitement. In front of you is a brightly decorated stage. One by one, the dog owners walk their special pets across it. You see a dog with a tongue that always hangs out the side of its mouth. You see another one with a wild hairstyle that looks like a rock star's. The announcer's voice booms over the speakers, telling funny and sweet stories about each dog. You don't just see the dogs; you feel the immense love their owners have for them.** It’s a truly heartwarming experience that has been going on for nearly 50 years.

The contest reminds us that being different is something to be proud of. These dogs are happy and healthy, and their owners think they are the most beautiful pets in the world. The event helps many rescue dogs find new families because people see how wonderful they are. We have learned from this event that true beauty comes from within. It’s about personality, love, and the special bond between a pet and its owner. This contest is a great example of how we can find joy in things that are *unconventional* (unusual/different) and celebrate what makes each of us, and each of our furry friends, one of a kind.

So, what do you think? If you were a judge at this contest, what qualities would you look for in a winner? Would you choose the dog with the funniest face, or the one with the most touching rescue story?

**Story 2: Student Engineers Become Real-Life Heroes in Flood Rescue**

What do you do with the knowledge you learn in school? For a group of university students in China, the answer is: use it to save the day! Students from Hohai University have recently shown everyone how powerful learning can be by stepping out of the classroom and onto the front lines of an emergency.

Recently, heavy rains caused a dangerous situation near a large reservoir in Beijing. A master's student named Lü Zhilong, who was doing an internship, immediately paused his vacation to rush to the scene. He and his classmates joined the emergency rescue team. This wasn't a school project; it was a real-life crisis where their skills were desperately needed. Their mission was to figure out why the riverbanks were collapsing and help find the best way to fix them. It was a *crucial* (very important/vital) task to protect the nearby communities.

For five days, these young engineers worked with their professors and professional rescue teams. **Imagine you are there, standing beside a fast-flowing river. The sound of the rushing water is deafening. You feel the ground shake slightly as giant trucks move around. You see the students pointing at maps, using high-tech tools to check the soil, and talking with experienced workers. They are not just watching; they are helping to guide huge machines that are dropping massive stones into the water to strengthen the river's edge.** They used their knowledge of water engineering to provide expert advice that helped make the rescue operation a success.

Hohai University has a long history of this kind of hands-on learning. For years, they have been working with companies and organizations to *cultivate* (develop/grow) top engineering talent. Since 2011, the university has sent almost 14,000 students out for at least a year of practical training. **That's like the entire population of a small town becoming engineering experts in the real world!** The university and its partners have invested a lot of money into these programs, showing how much they believe in learning by doing. Another student, Ma Luyao, said that these experiences helped him see with his own eyes how his studies could be applied to massive projects like the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, one of China's most famous engineering works.

This approach ensures that students don't just memorize facts from a book. They learn how to solve complex, real-world problems. They develop what is called "complex engineering system thinking," which means they can understand how many different parts of a big project work together. They are being trained to be the leaders and innovators of the future, the ones who will solve the world's biggest challenges. These brilliant young minds are building a better, safer world for everyone.

This story shows that what you learn today could help you become a hero tomorrow. If you could use what you learn in your science or math class to invent something, what would you create to help your family or your city?

  新闻大发现！今天我们要全力探索……砰！啪！哇！……世界上最独特的狗狗，还有工程界的学生超级英雄！

**第一条新闻：为独特的狗狗欢呼！“世界最丑狗狗大赛”开赛啦**

你有没有见过一只因为长相特别而获奖的狗狗？这事儿每年都在美国加州真实上演哦。一个非常有名又搞笑的活动——“世界最丑狗狗大赛”又回来啦，而且人们超级喜欢它！这可不是在嘲笑狗狗们，而是一场盛大的派对，专门庆祝那些长得有点与众不同的狗狗。

比赛在索诺玛县集市举行，吸引了成百上千的人。给你个概念，想象一下你们整个学校的学生，再加上另外两个学校的学生，全都聚集在一个阳光明媚的公园里。**那可是一千多号人，来为这些了不起的狗狗伙伴们加油打气呢！** 他们来看那些奇妙、奇怪又稀奇古怪的狗狗争夺冠军。这个活动的主要目的是鼓励大家从动物救助站领养狗狗。它告诉我们，每只狗狗，不管年龄、体型或外貌如何，都值得拥有一个充满爱的家。这传达了一个超棒的信息：美不仅仅是拥有完美的毛发或笔直的尾巴。

为啥说这是个全球性的新闻呢？因为许多参赛的狗狗品种都来自世界各地。举个例子，一种叫作“中国冠毛犬”的狗狗就经常赢得冠军。虽然它现在的样子是在美国（北美洲）培育出来的，但历史学家认为，它的祖先来自非洲或者中国（亚洲）。所以你看，这些小冠军们把来自不同大洲的故事带到了舞台上！简直不要太厉害！

让我们进入现场。**想象一下，你正站在加州阳光灿烂的集市里。你能感觉到温暖的阳光照在皮肤上，听到快乐的人群兴奋地嗡嗡讨论。你面前是一个装饰鲜艳的舞台。狗狗的主人一个接一个地带着他们特别的宠物走过。你看到一只狗狗的舌头总是从嘴边耷拉出来，另一只的发型狂野得像个摇滚明星。主持人的声音通过喇叭传出来，讲述着每只狗狗又搞笑又暖心的故事。你不仅看到了狗狗，更能感受到主人们对它们那满满的爱。** 这是一个已经举办了近50年的、真正温暖人心的活动。

这场比赛提醒我们，与众不同是一件值得骄傲的事情。这些狗狗们快乐又健康，在它们主人眼里，它们就是世界上最美的宠物。这个活动也帮助了许多被救助的狗狗找到了新家，因为人们看到了它们有多么棒。我们从中学到，真正的美发自内心。它关乎性格、爱，以及宠物和主人之间的特殊情谊。这个比赛就是一个很棒的例子，告诉我们如何在不那么“常规”的事物中找到快乐，并为那些让我们每一个人、每一只毛茸茸的朋友变得独一无二的特质而欢呼。

那么，你觉得呢？如果你是这场比赛的评委，你会看重冠军的哪些品质呢？你会选那只表情最滑稽的狗狗，还是那只有着最感人故事的狗狗？

**第二条新闻：学生工程师变身洪水救援中的“实战英雄”**

你在学校学到的知识能用来做什么呢？对于中国一群大学生来说，答案是：用它来拯救世界！最近，来自河海大学的学生们向所有人展示了学习的力量有多么强大，他们走出教室，奔赴到了紧急情况的第一线。

不久前，大雨导致北京一个大型水库附近出现了险情。一位名叫吕志龙的研究生，当时正在实习，他立刻中断假期，火速赶到现场。他和同学们一起加入了紧急救援队。这可不是什么学校作业，而是一场真正的危机，急需他们的专业技能。他们的任务是找出河堤坍塌的原因，并帮助找到最佳的修复方案。这是一项保护附近居民安全的关键任务，责任重大。

在五天的时间里，这些年轻的工程师和他们的导师以及专业救援队并肩作战。**想象一下你就在现场，站在一条水流湍急的河边。河水奔腾的声音震耳欲聋。你感觉脚下的大地随着巨型卡车的移动而微微震动。你看到学生们指着地图，用高科技设备检查土壤，和经验丰富的工人们讨论。他们不只是在旁边看哦，他们正在帮助指挥巨大的机器，把一块块巨石投进水里，来加固河岸。** 他们运用水利工程的知识，提出了专业的建议，为救援行动的成功出了一份大力。

河海大学一直都有这种“动手学习”的传统。多年来，他们和许多公司、机构合作，培养顶尖的工程人才。从2011年开始，这所大学已经派出了近14000名学生，进行至少一年的实践训练。**这数量，简直就像一个小镇的所有居民都出去成了现实世界里的工程专家！** 大学和合作伙伴们在这个项目上投入了大量资金，这表明他们非常相信“在实践中学习”的理念。另一位名叫马路遥的同学说，这些经历让他亲眼看到了自己学的知识是怎样应用到像“南水北调”这样宏伟的工程中的。

这种培养方式确保了学生们不只是死记硬背书本上的知识。他们学会了如何解决复杂的、现实世界中的难题。他们培养了一种叫做“复杂工程系统思维”的能力，意思就是他们能理解一个大项目中许多不同部分是如何协同工作的。他们正被培养成未来的领导者和创新者，去解决世界上那些最严峻的挑战。这些聪明的年轻人正在为所有人建设一个更美好、更安全的世界。

这个故事告诉我们，你今天所学的知识，也许明天就能让你成为一个英雄。如果你能用你在科学课或数学课上学到的东西来发明一样东西，你会创造什么来帮助你的家人或你的城市呢？
