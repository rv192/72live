News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow! A glowing squid from the deep sea and a super smart robot built by kids just like you!

First up, a fantastic find from the deep, dark ocean. Scientists have just announced an amazing discovery near the Mariana Trench (the deepest oceanic trench on Earth). They have found a brand-new species of squid that glows in the dark! They have named it 'Stellamaris Lumina', which means 'Star of the Sea, Light'. This creature is not just a little sparkly; it puts on a spectacular light show.

Imagine you are in a tiny submarine, thousands of meters under the ocean's surface. Everything outside your window is completely black. You can’t see a thing. Suddenly, you see a swirling galaxy of beautiful blue and green lights dancing in the water. That’s the Stellamaris Lumina! It feels like you are watching fireworks underwater. Scientists have seen these squids communicate with each other using these light patterns. They can change the color, brightness, and rhythm of their glow. It’s their special secret language!

The Stellamaris Lumina is about 30 centimeters long, about the size of a school ruler. But its light show can cover an area of about 10 square meters. That's like spreading out 20 large bath towels on the floor! This light is created by a special chemical reaction inside its body. It’s a process called bioluminescence. Researchers have studied these patterns and believe the squids use them to attract friends, warn enemies, and maybe even hunt for tiny fish in the total darkness. They have observed that different light sequences seem to mean different things, like a Morse code made of light. This deep-sea discovery helps us understand just how much life we have yet to find in the mysterious parts of our planet. It’s a beautiful reminder that our world is full of secrets. If you could send a message with light patterns like this squid, what would you want to say?

Now for our second story, let's blast off from the ocean depths to a sunny beach, where technology and teamwork have created something incredible. A group of middle school students from California, calling themselves the "Eco-Innovators" (a team of young environmental inventors), has won the top prize at the Global Youth Tech Challenge. And what did they build? A beach-cleaning robot named "Crab-Bot"!

This isn't just any robot. The students have designed it to look and move like a crab. It has six legs and scuttles sideways, just like a real crab. This special design helps it move easily on soft sand without getting stuck. But the cleverest part is its job: it finds and picks up microplastics. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic, smaller than a grain of rice, that *contaminate* (pollute/spoil) our beaches and oceans. They are very difficult to clean up by hand.

Picture yourself on a beautiful sunny beach. You feel the warm sand between your toes and hear the gentle waves. But when you look closely, you see tiny, colorful bits of plastic mixed in with the sand. Now, imagine a little Crab-Bot, moving quietly across the sand. It uses a special camera to spot the plastics and a small, gentle scoop to sift them from the sand. It’s a very *efficient* (effective/productive) little machine. The team has designed an impressive system.

So, how well does it work? The Eco-Innovators have tested it for months. In just one hour, a single Crab-Bot can clean an area the size of a school basketball court. During that time, it can collect up to 500 grams of microplastics. That's about the weight of 100 plastic bottle caps! The students have made the plans for their robot open-source, which means anyone in the world can build their own Crab-Bot. They hope to see armies of these little robots cleaning beaches everywhere. Their success has shown everyone that you are never too young to use your brain to help the planet. If you were to design a robot to solve a problem in your school or community, what would it do?

That's all the news for today. Keep being curious, and keep exploring!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾速解锁……Bang! Pop! Wow! 来自深海的发光乌贼（wū zéi），还有一个由像你一样的同学们制造出的超级智能机器人！

首先，是来自漆黑深海的一个奇妙发现。科学家们刚刚宣布，他们在马里亚纳海沟（地球上最深的海洋沟）附近有了一个惊人的发现。他们找到了一种全新的、会在黑暗中发光的乌贼！他们给它取名为“Stellamaris Lumina”，意思是“星海之光”。这个生物可不只是闪烁一点点微光哦，它简直就是上演了一场壮观的灯光秀。

想象一下，你正坐在一艘小小的潜水艇（qián shuǐ tǐng）里，下潜到海面下几千米的地方。窗外一片漆黑，什么都看不见。突然，你看到一个由美丽的蓝色和绿色光点组成的旋转星系，在水中翩翩起舞。那就是星海流光乌贼！感觉就像在水下看烟花一样。科学家们已经看到这些乌贼用这些光影图案互相交流。它们可以改变光芒的颜色、亮度和节奏。这是它们专属的秘密语言！

星海流光乌贼大约有30厘米长，和一把学校用的尺子差不多大。但是它的灯光秀可以覆盖大约10平方米的区域。这就好比在地板上铺开20条大浴巾那么大！这种光是它体内一种特殊的化学反应产生的，这个过程被称为“生物发光”（shēng wù fā guāng）。研究人员研究了这些发光模式，认为乌贼用它们来吸引同伴、警告敌人，甚至可能是在一片漆黑中捕捉小鱼。他们已经观察到，不同的发光顺序似乎代表着不同的意思，就像用光组成的摩斯密码。这个深海发现，让我们明白，在地球的神秘角落里，还有多少生命等着我们去发现。这简直酷毙了！如果你能像这种乌贼一样用光来发送信息，你会想说些什么呢？

现在来看我们的第二条新闻，让我们从海洋深处冲向阳光明媚的海滩，在那里，科技和团队合作创造出了令人难以置信的东西。一个来自加州的中学生团队，他们称自己为“生态创新者”（一群年轻的环保发明家），赢得了全球青年科技挑战赛的最高奖项。他们造了什么呢？一个名叫“螃蟹机器人”的海滩清洁机器人！

这可不是普通的机器人。同学们把它设计得看起来和移动起来都像一只螃蟹。它有六条腿，可以像真螃蟹一样横着走。这种特殊的设计帮助它在柔软的沙滩上轻松移动而不会被卡住。但最聪明的部分是它的工作：它能找到并捡起微塑料。微塑料是比一粒米还小的塑料碎片，它们会污染我们的海滩和海洋。用手清理它们可是非常困难的。

想象一下，你正置身于一个阳光明媚的美丽海滩上。你感觉到温暖的沙子从脚趾间流过，听到温柔的海浪声。但当你仔细看时，会发现沙子里混杂着五颜六色的小塑料碎片。现在，想象一个小小的螃蟹机器人，正在沙滩上安静地移动。它用一个特殊的摄像头来发现塑料，再用一个温柔的小铲子把它们从沙子里筛选（shāi xuǎn）出来。这真是一个高效的小机器，简直不要太厉害！

那么，它的工作效果如何呢？“生态创新者”团队已经测试了好几个月。仅仅一个小时，一台螃蟹机器人就能清理一个学校篮球场那么大的区域。在此期间，它可以收集多达500克的微塑料。这差不多是100个塑料瓶盖的重量！同学们已经将他们机器人的设计图纸开源，这意味着全世界的任何人都可以建造自己的螃蟹机器人。他们希望能看到成群结队的这种小机器人在世界各地的海滩上工作。他们的成功向所有人证明了，用智慧帮助地球，永远都不会嫌年纪小。如果你要设计一个机器人来解决学校或社区里的问题，你会让它做什么呢？

这就是今天所有的新闻啦。保持好奇，不断探索哦！
