**Amazing Glaciers Melting Across Continents**

Scientists have been studying glaciers in Antarctica and Europe for many years. They have found that glaciers have been melting faster than ever before. The ice that has melted from just one glacier could fill about 150,000 swimming pools! Imagine you standing on a huge ice field in Antarctica, hearing the cracking sounds of ice as it slowly moves meltwater into the ocean. Scientists have taken pictures of the same glaciers over ten years and have shown how much they have shrunk. The changes can be seen from space! What do you think would happen if all the glaciers melted completely? These glaciers are found in both Antarctica (which is in the southern polar region) and Europe (spanning many countries), affecting multiple continents. Researchers have been working hard to understand why this is happening and what we can do to help. They have noticed that the melting has increased (grown/become larger) during the past twenty years. What small actions could you take to help protect our planet's ice?

**Young Students Involved in Space Science Technology**

In exciting space news, children from around the world have been participating in a special space program organized by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). The program has invited students to design experiments that could be sent to the International Space Station. So far, NASA has received over 500 project ideas from young scientists aged 10 to 15! One team from Japan has created a tiny robot that can move around in zero gravity. Imagine floating inside the space station, watching as small robots fly by doing experiments. These students have been working with real astronauts who have been sharing their experiences from space. The children have learned how science in space can help us on Earth too. What kind of experiment would you like to send to space? The program has been running for three years and has inspired many young people to become interested in space science. The students' projects will be tested by astronauts on the space station next month.

**Creative Art Project Brings Communities Together**

A special art project has been bringing joy to children in many countries. Artists have been creating colorful murals in schools and communities to inspire young people. They have been using bright colors and nature themes to make the paintings come alive. The project has so far involved over 2,000 children from Asia, Europe, and Africa. Imagine walking into your school and seeing walls covered with beautiful paintings of animals, plants, and imaginary worlds, all created by students like you! The project has been helping children express their feelings and ideas through art. Maybe you could start a small art project with your friends too. The mural project has been organized by a group called "Art Without Borders" which believes that art can connect people. They have been sharing the children's artwork online so that everyone can enjoy it. How would you design a mural that shows what your community means to you?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索...
砰！啪！哇！

**令人惊叹的跨大洲冰川消融现象**

科学家们多年来一直在研究南极洲和欧洲的冰川。他们发现冰川正在以前所未有的速度融化。仅仅一个大冰川融化出的冰量竟然可以填满约15万个游泳池！想象一下，你站在南极洲广阔的冰原上，听着冰块断裂的声音，冰水缓缓流入海洋。科学家们拍摄同一冰川十年来的照片，展示了冰川大幅缩小的情况。这些变化甚至从太空中都能看到！你觉得如果所有冰川都完全融化会怎么样？这些冰川分布在南极洲（位于南极地区）和欧洲（跨越多个国家），影响了多个大洲。研究人员一直在努力了解为什么会发生这种情况以及我们能做些什么来帮助。他们注意到在过去二十年中，冰川融化程度不断增加（增长/变大）。你能采取什么小行动来帮助保护我们星球的冰层呢？

**小学生参与太空科技项目**

在令人兴奋的太空新闻中，来自世界各地的儿童参与了一项由NASA（美国太空总署）组织的特别太空项目。该项目邀请学生设计可以送往国际空间站的实验。迄今为止，NASA已经收到了来自10至15岁年轻科学家的500多个项目想法！来自日本的一个团队创造了一个能在零重力环境下移动的微型机器人。想象一下，你漂浮在空间站内，看着小机器人飞来飞去做实验。这些学生一直在与真正分享太空经验的宇航员合作。孩子们已经了解到太空中的科学如何也能帮助地球上的人们。你想把什么样的实验送到太空去？这个项目已经运行了三年，激发了许多年轻人对太空科学的兴趣。学生们的项目将于下个月由空间站的宇航员进行测试，简直不要太酷了！

**创意艺术项目连接社区**

一个特别的艺术项目给许多国家的孩子们带来了欢乐。艺术家们在学校和社区创作了色彩鲜艳的壁画，以激发年轻人的灵感。他们使用明亮的色彩和自然主题，让画作栩栩如生。迄今为止，该项目已经吸引了来自亚洲、欧洲和非洲的2000多名儿童参与。想象一下，当你走进学校，看到墙上布满了由像你一样的学生创作的动物、植物和奇幻世界的美丽画作！这个项目一直在帮助孩子们通过艺术表达他们的感受和想法。也许你也可以和朋友们一起开始一个小型艺术项目。壁画项目由一个名为"无国界艺术"的组织举办，他们相信艺术能够连接人们。他们一直在网上分享孩子们的艺术作品，让每个人都能欣赏。你会如何设计一幅展示你的社区对你意味着什么的壁画呢？
