News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring the amazing world of animals and technology!
Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever heard of leopard seals giving gifts to penguins? Scientists have discovered something incredible happening in both Antarctica and South Africa. These amazing animals, which can grow as long as 3.5 meters (that's about the length of a small car!), have been seen catching penguins and then offering them to humans as gifts. Imagine you're standing on an icy beach in Antarctica, the wind blows gently, and suddenly you see a leopard seal swimming toward you with a penguin in its mouth. You might feel scared, but the seal just wants to share its catch with you! Researchers believe this unusual behavior might be because these leopard seals have learned to see humans as friends rather than enemies. What would you do if a wild animal offered you a gift? Would you accept it or say no thank you?

Technology has taken an amazing step forward with children helping create new robots! At the World Robot Contest 2025, a team of students from the University of Macau has won a special prize for their brain-controlled robot. These young inventors, some as young as 12 years old, have built a robot that can move just by thinking about it! The robot uses special helmets that read brain signals, allowing people to control machines with their minds. Imagine sitting in a chair, wearing a cool helmet, and making a robot arm move just by thinking "pick up the ball." That's exactly what these students have accomplished (achieved/successfully done)! The team leader, Sarah, who is only 16 years old, explained that they worked for over six months to create this incredible machine. Their invention might help people who cannot move their arms or legs to do everyday tasks. If you could invent a robot, what would you want it to do?

Wouldn't it be amazing to create your own art exhibition? Many schools and communities around the world are organizing art shows where children can display their paintings, sculptures, and other creative works. You too can organize a small art exhibition with your friends! Start by collecting your best drawings or crafts, then find a place to display them – maybe your classroom or a community center. You can make simple signs to explain each artwork and even invite your family and classmates to visit. Remember, art is all about expressing yourself and sharing your ideas with others. What kind of art would you like to create for your very first exhibition?

新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索动物和科技的奇妙世界！
砰！啪！哇！

你有没有听说过豹海豹给企鹅送礼物的故事？科学家们在南极洲和南非发现了令人难以置信的现象。这些惊人的动物可以长到3.5米长（这相当于一辆小汽车的长度！），它们捕捉企鹅后会把企鹅当作礼物送给人类。想象一下你正站在南极洲的冰沙滩上，微风轻拂，突然你看到一只豹海豹嘴里叼着企鹅向你游来。你可能会感到害怕，但海豹只是想与你分享它的猎物！研究人员认为这种不寻常的行为可能是因为这些豹海豹已经学会了把人类当作朋友而不是敌人。如果一只野生动物给你礼物，你会怎么做？你会接受还是礼貌地拒绝呢？

科技在孩子们的参与下又迈出了惊人的一步！在2025年世界机器人大赛上，来自澳门大学的学生团队凭借他们的大脑控制机器人获得了特别奖。这些年轻的发明家中有些年仅12岁，他们制造了仅通过思考就能移动的机器人！这种机器人使用特殊头盔读取大脑信号，让人们能够通过思维来控制机器。想象一下你坐在椅子上，戴着酷酷的头盔，只需要思考"拿起球"，就能让机器人手臂移动。这正是这些学生完成的成就！团队领袖16岁的莎拉解释说，他们花了六个多月时间创造了这个令人难以置信的机器。他们的发明可能会帮助那些无法移动手臂或腿的人完成日常任务。如果你能发明一个机器人，你希望它能做什么？

举办自己的艺术展是不是很棒？世界各地的许多学校和社区正在组织艺术展，让孩子们展示他们的绘画、雕塑和其他创意作品。你也可以和朋友们一起组织一个小型艺术展！首先收集你最好的绘画或手工作品，然后找一个地方展示它们——可以是你的教室或社区中心。你可以制作简单的标签解释每件艺术作品，甚至邀请家人和同学来参观。记住，艺术就是表达自己，与他人分享你的想法。你想为你的第一次艺术展创作什么样的艺术作品呢？
