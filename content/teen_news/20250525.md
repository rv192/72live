News Discovery Time! Today we are exploring...
*(Sound Effect: Bang!)*
...cool cars...
*(Sound Effect: Pop!)*
...super sports...
*(Sound Effect: Wow!)*
...and amazing mixed-up learning!

First up, let's talk about a seriously famous car. A bright red Ferrari, once driven by a legendary driver named Michael Schumacher (迈克尔·舒马赫 - 一位非常著名的赛车手), has just been sold for a mind-blowing amount of money! This was the car he drove to win the famous Monaco Grand Prix (摩纳哥大奖赛 - 一场特别有名的赛车比赛) way back in 2001. It also helped him win another big race and secure one of his seven world championships!

This special car recently went to an auction (拍卖会 - 人们买卖东西，谁出的钱多谁就买到) in Monaco, right before this year's big race. And guess how much it sold for? A massive £13.43 million! To give you an idea of just how much that is, imagine getting 13.43 million shiny pound coins! Stacked up, they would be taller than the tallest building you've ever seen! That amount is also **equivalent to buying over 260 bars of pure gold**, which is incredibly heavy and valuable! It's now one of the most expensive F1 cars ever sold!

**Imagine you are sitting in that exact Ferrari.** You feel the smooth steering wheel under your hands. You hear the powerful engine roar to life, shaking the ground a little. The crowd is cheering loudly all around you. You see the finish line ahead, red and white stripes waiting. It feels speedy and exciting!

This amazing car, with its incredible history and record-breaking price, shows how much people value victory and the **legacy** (/heritage) of great champions. Cars like this are more than just machines; they are pieces of history!

Here's a question for you: If you had £13.43 million, what incredible, maybe slightly crazy, thing would you buy or do that could make history?

Next, let's zoom over to Inner Mongolia (内蒙古 - 中国北部的一个地方)! Something really fantastic has started happening in schools there this spring. Students are now getting **two hours** of physical activity *every single day*! This is part of a big effort to help kids stay healthy and happy.

Think about that: Two whole hours of moving around and playing! That's **equivalent to spending the time you normally have for about three regular school lessons** totally dedicated to sports and games! Schools are making sure there are short breaks for movement, plus longer sports sessions in the morning and afternoon. They are even getting principals involved to make sure this happens!

**Picture yourself on your school playground.** It's playtime! You could be running on the track, kicking a football, or maybe even trying something totally new! Schools are introducing all sorts of different activities, like cool martial arts moves, fun frisbee games, climbing up safe walls, or even trying winter sports and local dances! Some schools are even using small, unused spaces or building 'micro-fields' and 'micro-courts' to make sure there's always space to play. They are even using smart AI (人工智能 - 会学习和思考的电脑技术) sports equipment that can help you practice!

This focus on making sure kids get lots of exercise is super important. It helps make your body strong, your mind clear, and playing with friends is always a blast! To help schools offer all these great sports, Inner Mongolia is finding new sports teachers everywhere, working with sports clubs, and even asking former athletes to help out!

This is a big step towards making schools places where you don't just learn from books, but also become really strong and active!

So, our question for you is: If your school started offering two hours of sports every day with lots of new options, what new sport would you be most excited to **innovate** (/create new) and try?

Now for something really unique! Imagine having a teacher who is an expert in two completely different things. At Chongqing University (重庆大学 - 中国的一所大学), there's a professor who has a PhD in Physics (物理学博士 - 研究非常小的东西、能量和宇宙规律的科学家), which is all about science and numbers, but he teaches Creative Writing (创意写作 - 教你怎么写出有想象力的好故事), which is all about words and imagination! How cool is that?!

This professor, Mr. Liu Yang, loves both science fiction and science. He used to work in a science lab, studying really complex materials. But he also spent his nights writing amazing science fiction stories! He thinks his science background actually helps him write better stories because he understands how the real world works, which makes his made-up worlds feel more real.

**Step into his special classroom.** It looks like a normal classroom, but the ideas flying around are wild! You might hear students talking about how to describe a character's feelings using ideas from physics, or how to design a story for an AI program that can make its own choices! It's a place where science facts and wild story ideas crash together in the best way! He even uses AI to study *how* stories are written, looking for patterns!

He believes mixing science and writing like this is really important today. It shows that you don't have to choose just one path; you can be interested in many different things at once! This professor is a living example of how science and art can **integrate** (/blend together) beautifully.

Thinking about combining different ideas, here’s a question for you: If you could create a school subject by mixing any two totally different things you like – maybe cooking and coding, or history and drawing – what amazing mix would you create?

That's all for today's news! Keep exploring and stay curious!

新闻发现时间到！今天我们要探索…
*(音效：Bang!)*
…超酷的汽车…
*(音效：Pop!)*
…给力的大运动…
*(音效：Wow!)*
…还有神奇的混搭学习！

首先，我们来说一辆超级有名的汽车！一辆亮闪闪的红色法拉利（Ferrari - 一种很快的跑车品牌），它曾经是传奇赛车手迈克尔·舒马赫（Michael Schumacher - 一位非常非常厉害的赛车冠军）开过的战车！这辆车最近在拍卖会（拍卖会 - 大家出价，谁钱多东西就给谁）上被卖掉了，价格简直让人惊掉下巴！这可是他在2001年赢得 знаменитая 摩纳哥大奖赛（Monaco Grand Prix - 一场特别特别有名的赛车比赛）时开的车哦！这辆车还帮他赢了别的比赛，拿到了他七个世界冠军中的一个！

这辆特别的车就在今年的摩纳哥大奖赛前，被送到摩纳哥去拍卖了。猜猜卖了多少钱？足足1343万英镑！哇！这是个什么概念呢？**这笔钱差不多能买到超过260根沉甸甸的纯金条！**简直不要太厉害！现在，它成了卖得最贵的F1赛车之一了！

**想象一下，你就坐在那辆红色的法拉利里。**你摸着方向盘，光滑又舒服。你听到引擎发出“轰隆隆”的巨大声音，地面都在微微颤抖。旁边的观众都在为你疯狂欢呼！你看到终点线就在前面，红白色的格子好像在向你招手。感觉是不是又快又刺激！

这辆了不起的汽车，带着它辉煌的历史和打破纪录的价格，告诉我们大家有多么看重胜利和伟大冠军的**传承**。这些车不仅仅是机器，它们是一段段活生生的历史呢！

有个问题考考你：如果给你1343万英镑，你会买什么或者做什么了不起、也许还有点疯狂的事情，能让大家以后都记住呢？

接下来，我们一起“嗖”地一声飞到内蒙古（Inner Mongolia - 中国北方一个很美的地方）去看看！今年春天开始，那里的学校发生了一件超赞的事情！小朋友们现在**每天都有两个小时**的时间去参加体育活动！这是为了让大家身体更棒、更健康、更开心的重要行动！

你想想看，整整两个小时都在运动和玩耍！**这时间呀，差不多等于你平时上三节课的时间**，但全部都用来运动和玩了！学校们都可认真了，他们保证课间有时间跑跳，上午和下午都有不少于半小时的大课间体育活动。学校校长都要亲自研究怎么把这个“阳光体育大课间”搞得更好！

**想象一下，你就在学校的操场上。**现在是运动时间！你可以尽情地在跑道上撒欢，和朋友们踢足球，说不定还能尝试点新花样呢！学校们现在提供了好多好多好玩的运动项目，比如帅气的武术、有趣的飞盘、让你手脚并用的攀岩，甚至还有冰雪运动和当地的安代舞呢！为了让大家有地方动起来，有的学校还利用边边角角的空间，建起了小小的“微操场”或者“微球场”。更有意思的是，有些学校还用上了智能的AI（人工智能 - 能像人一样思考学习的电脑技术）运动设备，帮你练习得更好！

学校这么重视体育，真是太棒了！运动能让你的身体强壮得像小牛犊，大脑也变得更聪明！而且和朋友们一起玩，别提多开心了！为了让学校能有这么多活动，内蒙古正在想各种办法找更多体育老师，比如和体育学校合作，请专业的运动员来教大家！

这是让学校变得更生动、更有活力的一大步，在这里，你不只是在教室里学习，还能在运动中尽情释放天性，收获快乐和健康的身体！

所以呀，我们的问题来啦：如果你的学校也每天安排两小时运动，还多了好多新选择，你会最想**尝试**（或者说**探索**）哪种新的运动呢？

现在来听一件非常特别的事情！想象一下，你的老师是两个完全不一样领域的专家，这多酷呀！在重庆大学（Chongqing University - 中国西南的一所大学），就有一位老师，他拿的是物理学博士（Physics PhD - 研究很小很小的粒子、能量和宇宙运行规律的超级科学家）学位，物理学听起来都是公式和数字对吧？但他教的课却是创意写作（Creative Writing - 教你怎么写小说、诗歌等有想象力的文字），这可是关于文字和想象力的学科呀！这组合是不是超乎你的想象！

这位老师叫刘洋，他既喜欢科幻故事，也热爱科学研究。以前他在科学实验室里研究特别复杂的材料，但**同时**，他晚上还**笔耕不辍**地写着精彩的科幻小说！他觉得自己的科学背景特别有帮助，因为他了解真实的科学世界是怎么样的，这能让他写出来的科幻世界更有说服力、更真实。

**走进他这间特别的教室吧！**它看起来和普通教室差不多，但教室里飞扬的思想可一点都不普通！你可能会听到同学们讨论怎么用物理学的概念来描写人物的情绪波动，或者怎么为一个AI程序设计出有自己想法的故事线！在这里，科学的严谨和故事的奔放完美地**融合**（/结合）在了一起！他还用AI技术来研究小说，看看故事的结构有什么秘密！

刘老师认为，像这样把科学和写作结合起来，在今天特别重要。这告诉我们，你不用只选择一条路，你可以同时喜欢和学习很多不同的东西！这位老师就是一个最好的例子，证明了科学和艺术可以结合得多么漂亮！

想想把不同的东西放在一起会产生什么火花，这里有一个问题给你：如果让你创建一门学校的课程，把两个你最喜欢但完全不搭边的东西混合起来——比如烹饪和编程，或者历史和画画——你会创造出怎样一门神奇的新课程呢？

今天的青少年新闻速递就到这里啦！继续保持好奇心，多去发现哦！
