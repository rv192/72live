News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Our first discovery takes us far away, to Lima, Peru, in South America. A surprise happened last Sunday morning. Cameras *have captured* the moment when a **5.6 magnitude** earthquake started shaking during a church service inside a big church called a cathedral. People *felt* the ground move strongly and quickly *rushed out* because they were scared. The quake's center was about **23 kilometers off the coast** near Callao, recorded by the *USGS (United States Geological Survey)* in North America. This quake was strong enough to make buildings *tremble like jelly*. Imagine you were sitting quietly, listening, and suddenly the world around you *started shaking violently*! It must *have felt* quite frightening. Officials later said it caused some trouble, like a small landslide, and sadly, one person died. Peru's President *has asked* everyone to stay calm. Earthquakes can happen quickly, affecting places far and wide. This one connected South America and North America through its report! Imagine you were standing outside right after. What would you *see* or *hear*?

Next, something super clever made by a student! Do you ever open an app like a video site or a shopping app, wanting to find one thing, but then you start scrolling and scrolling, and *suddenly* hours *have passed*? This is called 'information overload', and it can make us forget what we wanted! A student named Leslie *has had* a great idea. She *has developed* an app called NoFeed. This app helps you go straight to the search bar! It's like having a super-fast shortcut button. You just type the app name and what you want to find, and NoFeed takes you right there, skipping the endless scrolling page. This app already supports over **20 different popular apps**, saving you the time equivalent of watching ten short videos every day! Leslie designed it to help people focus. Imagine you *feel* frustrated because you keep getting distracted online. Her app *has been* a helpful tool for many. It's smart, simple, and made by someone just like you! What apps do you think NoFeed could help you with most?

Our final cool find is about keeping old skills alive! In China, there's a very special kind of embroidery called Bian embroidery, which is a national treasure. At Kaifeng Vocational College in Henan province, students *have started* learning this beautiful old craft in a totally new way! This college *has opened* the first-ever major in Henan called 'Embroidery Design and Craft'. That's a big deal! They are teaching students not just how to sew, but also how to design new things with the old methods, using **over a thousand different types of stitches**, tiny threads creating amazing pictures. Imagine the students sitting there, their busy fingers working, bringing ancient patterns back to life! They *feel* the history in their hands with every stitch. The college *has also offered* fun classes for *all* students to try different traditional arts. Many students *have already learned* how to make their own small pieces. It helps keep these amazing traditions shining brightly! Close your eyes and imagine sitting at a wooden frame, holding a thin needle. You *feel* the smooth fabric and thread between your fingers, creating beautiful patterns just like people did hundreds of years ago. If you could learn any old craft, what would it be and what would you make?

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! See you next time!
