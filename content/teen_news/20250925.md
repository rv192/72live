## English Version
News Discovery Time! Today we're going to explore amazing animal friendships across continents! Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever heard of animals giving gifts to each other? Penguins in Antarctica and leopard seals in Australia have shown scientists something truly incredible! These black and white birds have been spotted receiving strange presents from their natural predators. Leopard seals, which normally hunt penguins for food, have been seen catching penguins and then offering them to other penguins as gifts! Scientists who have studied this behavior for over five years believe it might be a way for leopard seals to show friendship or playfulness.

Imagine you're standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, watching a group of penguins huddle together. Suddenly, a leopard seal surfaces nearby, holding a penguin in its mouth! But instead of eating it, the seal pushes the penguin toward the group on the ice. How would you feel seeing this unexpected act between predator and prey? Leopard seals can grow as long as 3.5 meters - that's longer than two adults lying head to toe! These amazing moments have been captured in both Antarctica and Australia, showing us that nature can surprise us with friendships across different continents.

What do you think these leopard seals are trying to say to the penguins? Are they really trying to make friends, or is there another reason for this strange behavior?

Now, let's zoom into the world of technology where young minds are making big changes! A group of students from Shenzhen, aged just 12 to 14, have created amazing robots that can help clean up plastic waste from beaches. These young inventors have been working for six months to design and build these helpful machines. Their robots have successfully collected over 500 kilograms of plastic from beaches in China and Southeast Asia.

The robots use special sensors to detect different types of plastic waste and can work for up to eight hours without needing a recharge. Each robot can move as fast as a person walking quickly and has arms that stretch longer than three basketballs placed end to end! The team has presented their invention at several technology fairs and has won awards for their creativity and problem-solving skills.

Imagine you're standing on a sunny beach, watching one of these robots moving across the sand, picking up plastic bottles and bags. The robot's bright lights flash as it identifies different types of waste, and its mechanical arms stretch out to grab the trash. If you could help design a robot to solve an environmental problem, what would your robot do and how would it work?

These young inventors have shown that you don't need to be a grown-up to make a big difference in the world!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索跨越大洲的奇妙动物友谊！砰！嘭！哇！

你听说过动物之间互赠礼物吗？南极洲的企鹅和澳洲的豹海豹向科学家展示了一些真正难以置信的事情！这些黑白相间的小鸟被发现从它们的天敌那里收到奇怪的礼物。通常以企鹅为食物的豹海豹，竟然被发现捕捉企鹅后，将它们作为礼物送给其他企鹅！研究这种行为超过五年的科学家们认为，这可能是豹海豹表达友谊或顽皮的方式。

想象一下你站在南极洲结冰的海岸边，看着一群企鹅挤在一起。突然，一只豹海豹在附近浮出水面，嘴里叼着一只企鹅！但它没有吃掉这只企鹅，而是把它推到了冰上的企鹅群中。看到天敌和猎物之间这种出人意料的举动，你会有什么感受？豹海豹可以长到3.5米长——比两个成年人头脚相接还要长！这些神奇的瞬间在南极洲和澳大利亚都被捕捉到了，向我们展示了大自然可以用跨越不同大洲的友谊让我们惊喜。

你认为这些豹海豹想对企鹅说什么？它们是真的想要交朋友，还是有其他原因导致这种奇怪的行为？

现在，让我们快速进入科技世界，看看年轻的头脑们如何带来巨大变化！一群来自深圳、年龄仅12到14岁的学生们创造了惊人的机器人，可以帮助清理海滩上的塑料垃圾。这些年轻发明家已经工作了六个月来设计和建造这些有用的机器。他们的机器人已成功从中国和东南亚的海滩上收集了超过500公斤的塑料。

这些机器人使用特殊传感器来检测不同类型的塑料垃圾，并且可以连续工作长达八小时而无需充电。每个机器人的移动速度相当于人快步行走的速度，其手臂展开长度比三个篮球首尾相连还要长！这个团队已经在几个科技展上展示了他们的发明，并因其创造力和解决问题的能力而获奖。

想象一下你站在阳光明媚的海滩上，看着这些机器人在沙滩上移动，拾捡塑料瓶和袋子。当机器人识别不同类型的垃圾时，它的亮灯会闪烁，机械臂伸出去抓取垃圾。如果你能设计一个解决环境问题的机器人，你的机器人会做什么？它将如何工作？

这些年轻发明家已经证明，你不需要长大也能在世界产生重大影响！简直不要太厉害！
