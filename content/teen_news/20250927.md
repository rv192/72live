News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring some amazing scientific discoveries and cool tech innovations! Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever wondered how animals behave differently around the world? Recently, scientists have discovered something incredible about birds that travel between continents. A special type of bird called the Arctic tern (北极燕鸥/běi jí yàn ōu) has amazed researchers with its extraordinary journey. These small seabirds have been found flying from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again each year, traveling a distance equivalent to circling the Earth three times! Imagine if you could fly across oceans and continents without stopping – that's what these amazing birds do. Scientists have been tracking them using tiny satellite tags and have discovered they can travel up to 96,000 kilometers in a single year. That's like flying from Beijing to New York and back 16 times! How do you think these birds know exactly where to go without using a map or GPS?

In other exciting news, technology is helping young people become space explorers! NASA (美国太空总署/Měi guó tài kōng zǒng shǔ) has invited students from around the world to participate in its newest Mars mission project. Children aged 10-14 have been designing experiments that could be conducted on the Red Planet. One group of middle school students from China has created a small robot to test Martian soil for signs of water. Their robot, called "Water Hunter," can dig into the ground and analyze samples to see if they contain (包含/have) any moisture. The students have been working with scientists via video calls and their design might actually be sent to Mars on the next mission! Imagine standing on the red, dusty surface of Mars, watching a robot you helped design search for water – that could become a reality for these young innovators. What kind of experiment would you like to send to space if you had the chance?

Finally, art and technology are coming together in creative ways! The Digital Art Festival, happening simultaneously in Tokyo and Paris this month, is showcasing amazing interactive installations where visitors can create their own digital masterpieces. One popular exhibit allows children to paint with light sensors – as they move their hands, colorful patterns appear on giant screens. Another exhibit lets visitors use special gloves to sculpt virtual clay into 3D shapes that can be printed and taken home as real objects! Artists and engineers have worked together to create these experiences that blend creativity with technology. Imagine dipping your hands into a pool of light and seeing it transform into beautiful patterns that dance across the walls – that's the kind of magic happening at this festival! Why not try creating your own digital art at home using simple apps on your parents' smartphones? You could start with photography apps that let you add fun effects to your pictures, or drawing apps that turn your doodles into animated characters!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰在科学发现和酷炫科技的世界里！砰！嘭！哇！

你有没有想过世界各地的动物行为有多么不同？最近，科学家们发现了一种关于跨洲鸟类飞行令人难以置信的现象。一种叫做北极燕鸥的特殊鸟类让研究人员惊叹不已。这些小型海鸟每年都会从北极飞到南极再飞回来，飞行距离相当于绕地球三圈！想象一下，如果你可以不停歇地飞越海洋和大洲——这些惊人的鸟儿就是这样做的。科学家们一直在使用微型卫星标签追踪它们，发现它们一年内可以飞行多达96,000公里。这简直不要太厉害，相当于从北京飞到纽约再往返16次！你觉得这些鸟儿是如何不使用地图或GPS就知道正确飞行方向的呢？

其它令人兴奋的新闻是，科技正在帮助年轻人成为太空探索者！美国太空总署邀请了来自世界各地的学生参与最新的火星任务项目。10-14岁的孩子们正在设计可以在火星上进行的实验。来自中国的一群中学生创造了一个小型机器人来测试火星土壤中是否有水的迹象。他们的机器人被称为"水猎人"，可以挖掘地下并分析样本，看它们是否含有任何水分。这些学生通过视频电话与科学家一起工作，他们的设计实际上可能会被送往参加下次火星任务！想象一下，站在火星红色尘土飞扬的表面上，看着你帮助设计的机器人寻找水源——这对这些年轻的创新者来说可能成为现实。如果你有机会，你想发送什么类型的实验到太空呢？

最后，艺术和科技正以创意的方式结合！"本月同时在东京和巴黎举行的数字艺术节正在展示令人惊叹的互动装置，参观者可以在那里创造自己的数字杰作。一个受欢迎的展览允许孩子们用光传感器作画——当他们移动手时，彩色图案就会出现在巨大的屏幕上。另一个展览让参观者使用特殊手套将虚拟粘土塑造成3D形状，这些形状可以被打印并作为实物带回家！艺术家和工程师们共同创造了这些融合创意与科技的体验。想象一下，将你的双手浸入光池中，看到它变成在墙壁上舞动的美丽图案——这就是这个艺术节上发生的奇迹！为什么不尝试在家里使用父母智能手机上的简单应用程序创作自己的数字艺术呢？你可以从允许你为照片添加有趣效果的应用程序开始，或者使用将你的涂鸦变成动画角色的绘图应用程序！
