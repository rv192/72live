News Discovery Time! Today we're exploring... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Have you ever heard of a bird that can fly across three continents? Scientists have discovered amazing migration patterns of Arctic terns (北极燕鸥/Arctic terns), small seabirds that travel from the Arctic to Antarctica and back every year! These tiny birds, weighing only about 100 grams each (that's as light as your smartphone), fly an incredible 70,000 kilometers annually. That's like flying twice around the Earth! Imagine standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, watching these brave birds arrive after their long journey from Europe and North America. Scientists have tracked them using special devices and found they sometimes rest on floating logs in the middle of the ocean. How do you think these tiny birds know where to go without a map or GPS?

In exciting technology news, NASA (美国太空总署/National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has invited teenagers to help design the next Mars rover! The "Mars Explorer Challenge" has allowed students aged 12-18 to submit ideas for the rover's tools and features. Fifteen-year-old Maya from California suggested a special drill that can collect (collect/gather) rock samples from deep underground. NASA scientists loved her idea so much that they're building a small version to test! Imagine you're walking on the red surface of Mars, seeing the rover you helped design digging for signs of ancient life. The students who participate in this program get a special tour of the NASA laboratory and can watch their ideas become reality through virtual reality headsets. What would you like to explore on Mars if you could help design a space mission?

Finally, for all the creative readers out there, there's a wonderful international art project called "Colors of Friendship" that you can join! Children from over 50 countries are creating artwork that represents their culture and sending it to be displayed in galleries around the world. The project has already received more than 5,000 paintings - that's enough artwork to cover 25 basketball courts! You can see colorful African masks next delicate Chinese calligraphy and vibrant Brazilian carnival scenes. Imagine your painting hanging in a museum in Japan, with children from another country smiling as they see your creative work. To participate, you just need a piece of paper, some colors, and your imagination! Draw something special about your home, family, or traditions, then send a photo of your artwork to the project's website. What would you draw to show others what makes your hometown special?

Remember to keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep creating! The world is full of amazing things waiting to be discovered!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要疾驰探索... 砰！啪！哇！

你听说过能横跨三大洲的鸟吗？科学家们发现了北极燕鸥惊人的迁徙模式！这种小小的海鸟每年都会从北极飞往南极然后再飞回来，简直不要太厉害！这些每只只有约100克重的小鸟（跟你的手机一样轻），每年能飞行7万公里，相当于饶地球飞行两圈！想象一下，你站在南极的冰岸边，看着这些勇敢的鸟儿从欧洲和北美洲飞来。科学家们用特殊设备追踪它们，发现它们有时候会在海洋中间的漂浮木头上休息。你觉得这些小鸟没有地图或GPS，是怎么知道飞往哪里的呢？

在令人兴奋的科技新闻中，NASA（美国太空总署）邀请青少年帮助设计下一辆火星探测车！"火星探索者挑战"让12到18岁的学生提交关于探测车工具和功能的想法。来自加州的15岁女孩玛雅建议了一种特殊钻头，可以从地下深处收集岩石样本。NASA科学家们非常喜欢她的想法，以至于他们正在制作一个小型版本进行测试！想象一下，你走在火星红色表面，看着你参与设计的探测车挖掘古老生命的迹象。参与这个计划的学生可以获得NASA实验室的特殊参观机会，并通过虚拟现实头显看着他们的想法变成现实。如果你能帮助设计太空任务，你想在火星上探索什么？

最后，对于所有有创意的读者，有一个名为"友谊色彩"的精彩国际艺术项目可以参加！来自50多个国家的孩子们正在创作代表他们文化的艺术品，并送到世界各地的画廊展出。这个项目已经收到了5000多幅画作，足够铺满25个篮球场！你可以看到色彩鲜艳的非洲面具旁边挂着精致的中国书法和充满活力的巴西狂欢节场景。想象一下，你的画作挂在日本的博物馆里，另一个国家的孩子们看到你的创意作品时露出微笑。要参与其中，你只需要一张纸、一些颜色和你的想象力！画出关于你的家乡、家庭或传统的特别之处，然后将你的作品照片发送到项目网站。你会画什么来向他人展示你家乡的特别之处呢？

记住，继续保持探索，继续提问，继续创造！世界上充满了等待发现的精彩事物！
