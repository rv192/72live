**Animal Friendship Between Continents: Penguins and Leopard Seals**

Scientists have discovered something amazing about animals living across two different continents! In Antarctica and South Africa, researchers have found that leopard seals sometimes "play" with penguins in a surprising way. These powerful seals, which live in Antarctica (the southernmost continent), sometimes catch penguins but don't eat them right away. Instead, they release them and catch them again, like a cat playing with a mouse.

Imagine you are standing on the icy shores of Antarctica, watching a leopard seal gently toss a penguin into the air. You would see the slippery (wet/smooth) seal swimming gracefully while the confused penguin tries to escape! This extraordinary behavior has been observed by scientists from both Antarctica and South Africa, making it a true cross-continental discovery.

The research team has counted over 67 such interactions in the past three years. That's like finding a unique animal friendship in every single school in a large city! Scientists believe this might be how young seals practice their hunting skills.

What other surprising animal friendships do you think might exist between different continents?

**AI for Everyone: Kids Help Train Medical Technology**

Exciting news from the world of technology! Children aged 10-14 have been helping to train artificial intelligence (AI) systems that assist doctors. Neuralink (Noo-ral-link / a brain-computer company) has created a special program where kids solve puzzles that help AI learn how to understand human thoughts better.

Picture yourself sitting in a colorful room with a special headset on. You can see and feel the computer responding to your thoughts like magic! Young participants from schools across America and Asia have joined this program, making it a truly global effort. These tech-savvy (skilled with technology) kids have helped improve the AI system by 35% in just six months.

The Neuralink technology has already helped people who cannot move their arms to eat and drink by themselves. This is like helping more than 1,000 people regain independence! The children who participated said they felt proud to be part of something that changes lives.

If you could design an AI to help solve one problem in the world, what would it be and why?

**Create Your Own Nature Art Project**

Art and nature come together in this exciting hands-on activity you can try at home! Artists around the world are creating beautiful works using only materials they find outside. This project is super fun and helps you connect with nature in a creative way.

Imagine walking through your neighborhood park or backyard, collecting fallen leaves, smooth stones, colorful flowers, and interesting twigs. You can feel the different textures and see all the amazing colors nature provides! These natural materials can be arranged to make stunning pictures, sculptures, or even jewelry.

One artist in Japan created a huge butterfly design using over 500 colorful leaves, covering an area as big as four ping-pong tables! You don't need that many to start though - begin with just 10-15 interesting items you find outside.

Arrange your collected items on a piece of paper or cardboard to create a picture or pattern. You could make a animal shape, a flower, or an abstract design with different colors. When you're happy with your creation, ask an adult to help you take a photo, since nature art is temporary (doesn't last forever).

What natural materials are most common where you live, and what would you like to create with them?

**跨大陆动物奇缘：企鹅与豹海豹**

科学家们发现了一个令人惊奇的跨大陆动物现象！在南极洲和南非，研究人员发现豹海豹有时会以一种出人意料的方式与企鹅"玩耍"。这些生活在南极洲（地球最南端的大陆）的强壮海豹，有时会捕捉企鹅但不会立刻吃掉它们。相反，它们会放出企鹅然后再抓回来，就像猫玩老鼠一样。

想象一下你站在南极洲的冰岸上，看着一只豹海豹轻轻地把企鹅抛向空中。你会看到那滑溜的海豹优雅地游泳，而困惑的企鹅则拼命试图逃脱！这个非凡的行为被来自南极洲和南非的科学家们观察到，使它成为真正的跨大洲发现。

研究团队在过去的三年里记录了超过67次这样的互动。这就像在一个大城市的每所学校里都找到一个独特的动物友谊！科学家们认为这可能是年轻海豹练习捕猎技巧的方式。

你认为还有哪些出人意料的跨大陆动物友谊可能存在？

**人工智能人人参与：孩子们助力训练医疗科技**

来自科技世界的激动消息！10至14岁的孩子们一直在帮助训练辅助医生的人工智能系统。Neuralink（神经链接/一家脑机接口公司）创建了一个特殊项目，让孩子们解决谜题，帮助AI更好地理解人类思想。

想象一下，你坐在一个色彩缤纷的房间里，戴着一个特殊的头戴设备。你可以看到并感觉到电脑像魔法一样对你的思想做出回应！来自美国和亚洲各地学校的孩子们参与了该项目，使之成为真正的全球性努力。这些精通技术的孩子们在短短六个月内将AI系统的性能提高了35%。

Neuralink技术已经帮助手臂无法活动的人们自己进食和饮水。这就像帮助了1000多人重获独立！参与其中的孩子们表示，他们为自己能参与改变生活的技术感到自豪。

如果你能设计一个AI来解决世界上的一个问题，那会是什么？为什么？

**创建你自己的自然艺术项目**

艺术与自然在这个激动人心的动手实践活动中结合在一起，你可以在家尝试！世界各地的艺术家正在使用仅从户外找到的材料创作美丽作品。这个项目超级有趣，还能帮助你有创意地与自然建立联系。

想象一下，你漫步穿过附近的公园或后院，收集落叶、光滑的石头、五彩缤纷的花朵和有趣的树枝。你可以感受到不同的质地，看到大自然提供的所有惊人色彩！这些天然材料可以被排列成制作精美的图片、雕塑甚至首饰。

日本一位艺术家使用500多片彩叶创作了一个巨大的蝴蝶设计，覆盖面积相当于四个乒乓球桌那么大！不过你不需要那么多材料才能开始——只需用你在户外找到的10-15件有趣物品就可以了。

把你收集的物品在纸或纸板上排列，创作出图案或形状。你可以制作动物形状、花朵，或者用不同颜色创作抽象设计。当你对自己的创作满意时，请请大人帮你拍张照片，因为自然艺术是暂时的（不会永远保存）。

在你居住的地方，哪些天然材料最常见？你想用它们创作什么呢？
