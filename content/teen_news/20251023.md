News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore… Bang! Pop! Wow!

(Upbeat intro music)

Hello, super students, and welcome back to our weekly news express! Today, we have two amazing stories for you. First, we’ll sprint over to a university that has created a special class to help students get stronger and healthier. Then, we’ll journey into a museum where old machines tell incredible stories of science. Let’s get started!

Our first stop is Northwest A&F University, or NAFU for short. Here, they have started a very popular course called the "Fat-Reduction and Shaping" class. This isn't your typical gym class! It has been designed specifically for students who want to improve their health in a supportive and scientific way. One student, Zhao Zimeng, joined because she wanted to be healthier and feel more confident. At first, many students, including Zhao, felt a little shy. But that feeling didn't last long. Soon, the classroom was filled with energy and friendship. The students have been sharing everything from exercise tips to which healthy meals are the best in the school cafeteria. This sense of teamwork is a huge part of their success.

Let's look at the results. Last semester, the 168 students in the course lost an average of 14.68 jin each. That’s about 7.3 kilograms! To help you feel that, imagine carrying around 15 big bottles of water all day. Now, imagine putting them all down. That’s the amount of weight they have lost! One student, Zhang Haonan, had an incredible *transformation/change*. He lost 60.2 jin, which is over 30 kilograms! He said he worked hard every single day, and though fighting hunger was tough, seeing the results made it all worthwhile. Now, he feels so great that he often helps other students, sharing tips on diet and exercise. He has said that self-discipline gives him a feeling of freedom.

So, how does this special class work? It's a mix of fun aerobic exercises to burn fat and strength training to build muscle. But the work doesn't stop when the class ends. Students are also *motivated/encouraged* to track their daily meals and make sure they are eating healthy food, avoiding things that are too oily or salty. They also need to record their daily steps. The final grade isn't just about weight loss; it's about participation, healthy habits, and improvements in physical fitness tests. Because of the teacher's dedication, the course has been a great success. What a fantastic way of fighting fat and finding fitness! If your school offered a special class focused on health, what kind of fun activity would you want to include?

(Transition music)

Now, from building stronger bodies, let’s travel to a place where brilliant minds have built our modern world. We are heading to the Tsinghua University Science Museum! This place is a real treasure chest, holding over 8,000 scientific artifacts from history. If you decided to spend just one minute looking at each item, it would take you more than five full days, without stopping to eat or sleep, to see them all! The museum’s director, Wu Guosheng, proudly explains that this is the first comprehensive science museum of its kind in the country, gathering important scientific instruments and technical creations all under one roof.

What makes this museum truly special is how they got these treasures. They have a "collect, buy, and build" strategy. They collect old instruments from around the university, buy rare items from overseas, and—this is the coolest part—they build their own copies of lost technological masterpieces. Recreating these old machines is not easy. It’s like being a detective and an engineer at the same time. For example, the team tried to *replicate/copy* an old machine called the Hawksbee generator, which makes static electricity. But they ran into a strange problem: their new machine didn’t work as well as the original one from history! After much investigation, they discovered the reason. The glass they were using was too modern and too pure! Old glass had more impurities, which actually helped it create static electricity. So, the team had to make glass using an old recipe to make the machine work correctly.

Imagine you are on that team. You can feel the frustration when the machine fails, but then you see the first spark of success after solving the puzzle! This hands-on work helps everyone understand the scientific *principle/rule* behind the invention. The museum has even recreated a massive and complex astronomical clock tower from the Song Dynasty, over 1,000 years ago, to inspire young people.

Students are a big part of this museum. Yang Mingfan, a master's student, is a volunteer guide. He loves sharing the real stories behind science. He once told visitors that the famous story about James Watt inventing the steam engine just from watching a kettle lid is not entirely accurate. He says digging for the real facts is what the spirit of science is all about. This marvelous museum of machines shows us that science is a long journey of trial, error, and amazing discovery. What is a science story you have heard, and how could you check if it is completely true?

(Outro music)

And that’s all the time we have for today's News Discovery Time! We’ve seen how students are building healthier habits and how a museum is rebuilding history. Stay curious, keep asking questions, and we'll see you next time!

  News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索…… Bang! Pop! Wow!

（欢快的开场音乐）

各位超级同学们好，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报！今天，我们为你准备了两个超赞的故事。首先，我们将飞奔到一所大学，那里开设了一门特别的课程，帮助学生们变得更强壮、更健康。然后，我们将勇闯一座博物馆，在那儿，古老的机器会讲述令人难以置信的科学故事。我们这就出发吧！

我们的第一站是西北农林科技大学。在这里，他们开设了一门非常受欢迎的课程，叫做“减脂塑形”课。这可不是你想象中的普通体育课哦！它是专门为那些希望用科学、互助的方式来改善健康的学生们设计的。一位叫赵梓萌的同学，为了更健康、更自信，就报名参加了。起初，包括小赵在内的很多同学都有点不好意思。不过，这种感觉很快就烟消云散了。没过多久，教室里就充满了活力和友谊。同学们简直无话不谈，从运动技巧到推荐食堂里哪个窗口的饭菜最清淡。这种团队合作的感觉，是他们成功的重要原因。

让我们来看看成果。上个学期，选修这门课的168名学生，平均每人减重14.68斤。这大约是7.3公斤！为了让你感受一下，想象你一整天都拎着15大瓶矿泉水。现在，再想象一下把它们全部放下。他们减掉的重量，差不多就是这么重！还有一位叫张皓男的同学，他的改变简直是脱胎换骨。他总共减掉了60.2斤，超过30公斤！他说自己每天都拼尽全力，虽然忍住饥饿很难，但看到成果就觉得一切都值了！现在，他感觉状态爆棚，还经常帮助其他同学，分享饮食和锻炼的技巧。他觉得，自律带给他的是一种自由的感觉。

那么，这门神奇的课程是怎么运作的呢？它结合了有趣的燃脂有氧运动和增肌的力量训练。但努力并不会在下课后就停止。学校鼓励同学们记录每天的饮食，确保吃得健康，避开太油太咸的食物。他们还需要记录自己每天的步数。期末成绩不只看减了多少体重，而是综合了出勤、健康习惯的养成以及体能测试的进步。因为老师的用心付出，这门课大获成功。这种与脂肪战斗、寻找健康的方式，简直不要太厉害！如果你的学校也开设一门关注健康的特别课程，你希望加入什么样的趣味活动呢？

（过渡音乐）

好了，从塑造更强的身体，我们再去一个地方，那里杰出的头脑构建了我们的现代世界。我们即将前往清华大学科学博物馆！这个地方真是一个真正的宝库，收藏了超过8000件历史上的科学藏（cáng）品。假如你决定花一分钟看一件展品，那么不吃不喝不睡，也要花上五天多的时间才能全部看完！博物馆馆长吴国盛自豪地介绍说，这是国内第一个综合性的收藏型科学博物馆，把历史上的重要科学仪器和技术制品都聚集在了一起。

让这座博物馆与众不同的是他们获得这些宝藏的方式。他们有一个“收集、购买和制造”的策略。他们从大学各处收集旧仪器，从海外购买珍稀物品，而且——这是最酷的部分——他们还亲手制造失传已久的科技杰作的复制品。复原这些古老的机器可不容易。这感觉就像同时在当一名侦探和一名工程师。比如，团队曾尝试复原一台能产生静电的古老机器——霍克斯比起电机。但他们碰上了一个奇怪的难题：他们的新机器效果不如历史记载的原版好！经过大量研究，他们发现了原因。原来，他们用的玻璃太现代化、太纯净了！古代的玻璃含有更多杂质，反而更容易产生静电。于是，团队必须用古法重新制作玻璃，才让机器正常工作。

想象你就是那个团队的一员。当机器失败时，你能感受到那种挫败感，但在解开谜题后，你又亲眼看到了第一束成功的火花！这种动手实践，能帮助每个人理解发明背后的科学原理。博物馆甚至还复原了一座来自一千多年前宋朝的、巨大而复杂的天文仪器——水运仪象台，它的目的就是为了激励年轻人。这座仪器体现了古代中国在天文、机械和冶（yě）金技术上的最高成就。

学生们也是这个博物馆的重要组成部分。硕士生杨明繁就是一位志愿者讲解员。他特别喜欢分享科学背后真实的故事。他曾告诉参观者，关于瓦特看到水壶盖被顶起就发明了蒸汽机的那个著名故事，其实不完全准确。他说，努力探寻真相，这才是科学精神的核心。这座奇妙的机器博物馆告诉我们，科学是一场充满了尝试、失败和伟大发现的漫长旅程。你听说过什么样的科学故事呢？你又会用什么方法去验证它的真伪呢？

（结尾音乐）

今天的新闻探索时间到这里就全部结束啦！我们看到了学生们如何建立更健康的生活习惯，也看到了一座博物馆如何重现历史。保持好奇，不断提问，我们下期再见！
