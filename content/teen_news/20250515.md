News Discovery Time! Today, we're exploring...

Bang! Pop! Wow!

First up, let's dive into the amazing world of tiny monkeys! Have you ever seen a monkey that looks a bit like a character from a cartoon, maybe with funny white hair around its ears? That's the **Common Marmoset** (普通狨). These little guys are super small, only about 15 centimeters long! Can you imagine? That's about the length of a short ruler, or like stacking 15 toy blocks! They live in the big rainforests of **Brazil** (巴西) in South America, swinging through the trees.

Scientists around the world, like in **Germany** (德国) and **Japan** (日本), have been studying these marmosets. Why? Because they are quite similar to humans in some ways, and they have babies pretty often, sometimes even twins! This has made them `essential / important` for understanding how bodies work and how illnesses start. Imagine you are deep in the lush green Amazon rainforest, the air is warm and humid, and you hear the tiny squeaks and see these furry friends leaping from branch to branch above you. It's a secret world happening all around! Scientists have even made a super detailed 'map' of their bodies inside to learn more. These mighty monkeys have helped us learn so much already!

If you were a scientist, what kind of animal would you want to study, and what secrets do you think they could share with us?

Next, we're looking at something many of you use every day: online videos and platforms like **Douyin** (抖音), which is very popular. Videos of kids playing, dancing, or just being funny have become super popular, turning some into "child stars." But this has also started a big `controversy / disagreement` across the country about whether this is always good for the children.

Take one famous example: a little girl in **Guizhou** (贵州) province whose daily life videos gained over 20 million fans! Wow! Imagine gathering 20 stadiums full of people – that's how many fans she has! Her videos have gotten more than 600 million likes. That's like *everyone* in many big countries liking her videos! While many find her cute, one video showed her falling, and her mom kept filming and even laughed, which made people worry. They wondered if the family was making a lot of money from ads related to her popularity and if the videos were always `ethical / fair` to her.

Experts have said they are worried about kids being used just to get clicks and money, and about videos that might show children doing unsafe things. Luckily, China has been taking steps to make the online world safer for kids. New rules have come out, and authorities have shut down over 1.1 million accounts that were harming kids' online environment. Imagine learning in school how to be safe and smart when you're online, like knowing not to share too much or how to report things that don't feel right. It's super important! Schools and even courts have been working to give kids better online safety lessons.

What kind of videos do you think are the most fun and safest for kids to watch or be in?

Finally, let's talk about something yummy – food and how we see it on screen! Have you ever watched a food documentary or a show about cooking that just made your mouth water? These shows are a kind of art, combining delicious food with interesting stories. For example, there's a famous documentary series in China called "Once Upon a Bite" (风味人间) or "Street Food" (人生一串).

One popular show about street food got a super high rating of 8.6 out of 10 from viewers on a website called **Douban** (豆瓣)! Imagine almost everyone who watched it saying it was amazing! It has several episodes, each about 45 minutes long, showing all sorts of yummy treats like grilled meats, different noodles, and special local snacks from different places. Imagine sitting down after finishing your homework, feeling a bit hungry, and putting on a show that takes you on a journey through delicious sights and sounds. You can almost smell the tasty food! It’s `fascinating / very interesting` to see how different people make food in their own special ways. They use simple tools or fancy grills, adding secret sauces and spices.

Watching these shows is fun, and it can also inspire you! What's your favorite food to watch being made on a show? Maybe you could even try making a simple snack yourself that you saw on a show, like some easy grilled vegetables or a simple fruit dessert! Happy watching and happy eating!

新闻探索时间到！今天我们要**疾速**探索...

Bang! Pop! Wow!

首先，我们一起**跳进**小猴子的奇妙世界！你们有没有见过一种小猴子，长得有点像动画片里的角色，耳朵旁边毛茸茸的，白白的，就像是**顶着一团可爱的白云**？它们就是**普通狨**（pǔ tōng róng）。这些小家伙超级迷你，才15厘米那么长！简直太小了！你们想想，15厘米，差不多就是一个短尺子那么长，或者像摞了15块乐高积木一样高！它们住在南美洲**巴西**（bā xī）的大森林里，喜欢在树上**跳跃玩耍**。

世界各地的科学家们，比如在**德国**（dé guó）和**日本**（rì běn），一直在**认真地研究**它们。为什么呢？因为它们在一些地方跟人类挺像的，而且它们生小猴子生得比较快，有时候还一生就生两只！这让它们对科学家们了解身体怎么工作、病是怎么来的，**简直太有用了**！想象一下，你站在茂密的亚马逊雨林深处，空气暖暖的、湿湿的，你能听到小小吱吱的声音，看到这些毛茸茸的朋友在你头顶的树枝间**跳来跳去**。那感觉**真是太酷了**！科学家们还给它们做了身体里面的超级详细“地图”，想知道更多秘密。这些**了不起的小猴子**已经帮我们学到了好多知识呢！

如果你是一名小科学家，你最想研究哪种小动物呢？你觉得它们能告诉我们什么有趣的小秘密呀？

接下来，我们要**瞧瞧**你们很多人每天都在用的东西：网上视频和像**抖音**（dǒu yīn）这样的软件。好多关于小朋友玩耍、跳舞或者做出有趣表情的视频**火遍全网**，让一些小朋友变成了大家口中的“小童星”。但这也在咱们国家引起了一场关于这样做对小朋友是不是总好的**大讨论**！

举个例子，有个来自**贵州**（guì zhōu）的小姑娘，她拍自己日常生活的小视频，**竟然**有2000多万粉丝！哇塞！你们想想，2000万粉丝，差不多就是20个大体育场加起来的人那么多！她的视频点赞数超过了6亿！这简直是好多大国家所有人都点赞的节奏呀！虽然很多人觉得她很可爱，但有个视频里，她摔倒了，妈妈还在继续拍甚至笑了，这让大家有点担心。大家都在想，是不是家里人为了挣钱，让小朋友拍一些不是特别好的视频，对她不太**公平**？

专家们都说，他们很担心小朋友被大人用来只为了赚点击量和钱，也担心有些视频里小朋友会做一些不安全的事情。不过，还好我们国家一直在**努力地想办法**，让网络世界对小朋友更安全。现在有了新的规定，相关的部门已经关掉了110多万个对小朋友不好的账号！你们想象一下，在学校里，老师会教你怎么安全地上网，知道什么不能随便分享，看到不好的东西怎么**快速地举报**。这**简直太重要了**！学校甚至法院都在一起合作，给小朋友们更多的安全上网课。

你们觉得什么样的儿童视频最有趣，也最安全，无论是看还是自己拍呢？

最后，我们来**聊点**好吃的东西——以及我们怎么在屏幕上看到它们！你们有没有看过那种关于美食的纪录片或者做饭的节目，看得你**直流口水**？这些美食节目就像一种特别的艺术，把好吃的东西和有趣的故事**放在一起**。比如，中国有个特别火的美食纪录片系列，像《风味人间》或者《人生一串》。

有一个讲街头烧烤的节目，在**豆瓣**（dòu bàn）这个网站上得到了8.6分的高分！你们想想，满分是10分，几乎所有看了的人都说它**太好看了**！它有好几集，每集差不多45分钟，展示了各种各样好吃的，比如烤肉、不同的面条，还有各个地方的特色小吃。想象一下，放学回家，写完作业，肚子有点饿，**舒服地坐下来**，打开一个美食节目，就像跟着它去旅行一样，看到了很多美味的画面，好像都能闻到香喷喷的味道了！看看不同的人用自己的**特别方法**做食物，真是**让人着迷**！他们可能用简单的工具，也可能用很酷的烤架，加上他们自己的秘密酱料和调料。

看这些节目特别开心，而且还能给你带来**新的灵感**！你在节目里最喜欢看别人做哪种好吃的呀？说不定你也可以试试自己动手，做一个你在节目里看到的简单小零食，比如烤几个简单的蔬菜或者做个水果甜点什么的！希望你们看得开心，吃得也开心！
