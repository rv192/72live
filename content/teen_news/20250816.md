(Upbeat, energetic music starts and fades to the background)

**Host:** News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore… Bang! Pop! Wow! …glowing forests, smart robots, and sunshine art! Hello, everyone, and welcome to our weekly news roundup for curious minds! I'm your host, Alex, and we have some truly amazing stories for you today. So, let’s get started!

Our first story takes us deep into some of the world's oldest forests. Scientists have recently observed a truly bizarre and beautiful **phenomenon/event**. In the Amazon rainforest in South America and the Daintree Rainforest in Australia, a special type of mushroom has started to glow in the dark! This is called bioluminescence, but what makes this special is that thousands of kilometers apart, these fantastic fungi are glowing in the exact same pulsing pattern. It’s like they are sending secret messages to each other across the entire Pacific Ocean.

Researchers in **Mycology** (the study of fungi) have never seen anything like this. They have recorded the flashes and discovered a complex rhythm, almost like a secret code. These mushrooms, which scientists have nicknamed "Star Spores," cover huge areas of the forest floor. **(A) If you were to combine all the glowing patches from both continents, they would cover an area equal to 5,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools!** That’s a massive natural light show.

**(B) Imagine this: you are walking through the dark, damp rainforest at night. You can hear the sounds of strange insects and feel the soft leaves under your feet. Suddenly, the ground around you begins to glow with a soft, pulsing blue light. Little spots of light appear and disappear in a perfect rhythm, lighting up the path in front of you. You feel like you've stepped into a magical fairy tale.** Scientists are now trying to understand if this is a new form of long-distance communication. **(C) If you could send a message with these glowing fungi, what would you want to say to the world?**

(Short musical transition)

Next up, we are blasting off from the forest floor to outer space… or at least, preparing for it! Our second story is about technology, creativity, and some very clever kids. **NASA** (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the USA) has recently announced the winners of its annual "Mars Helper Robot" competition for middle school students. The challenge was to design and build a small robot that could help astronauts on a future Mars mission.

And the winning team is from a school in Tokyo, Japan! A group of five 12-year-old students has created an **innovative/new** robot they named "Kuri-chan," which means "Little Chestnut" in Japanese. Kuri-chan’s special job is to sort Martian rocks. It uses a clever claw and a smart camera to identify different types of soil and pebbles, separating the interesting ones for scientists to study. The students have worked for over six months on this project, learning coding and engineering skills.

**(A) Kuri-chan is tiny—it's no bigger than three lunch boxes stacked on top of each other. But don't let its size fool you! Its special arm is so strong it can lift a rock that weighs as much as 20 large apples.** The team presented their robot at a global science fair, and the judges were amazed by its simple but effective design. **(B) Picture this: you are one of the first astronauts walking on the red, dusty surface of Mars. The sky is a pinkish color, and you can see Earth as a tiny blue dot far away. Beside you, your little robot friend Kuri-chan is rolling along, carefully picking up interesting rocks and putting them in a special container. You feel safe and proud because a robot designed by kids is helping you make huge discoveries.** The winning team has won a trip to visit a NASA space center next year. **(C) If you could design a robot helper for your daily life, what special task would you want it to do?**

(Short musical transition)

For our final piece of news, let’s talk about art and sunshine! A very old and beautiful art **technique/method** from the 1800s has become super popular again, thanks to social media. It's called **Cyanotype** (pronounced sy-AN-o-type), but you might know it by its cooler name: sun-printing! An amazing exhibition has just opened in Paris, France, showing how modern artists are using this old process to create stunning blue and white pictures.

So, how does it work? It’s almost like magic. Artists use special paper coated with a mix of safe chemicals. They place objects on the paper—like leaves, flowers, feathers, or even stencils—and then put it out in the sun. The sunlight causes a chemical reaction everywhere except for where the objects are blocking the light. After a few minutes, they wash the paper in water, and a beautiful, detailed image in a deep blue color appears!

**(A) The Paris exhibition features over 200 cyanotype artworks. Some are small and delicate, but one giant piece created by a team of artists is as long as a full-sized school bus!** It shows a life-sized image of a blue whale, all made with sunlight. **(B) Let's pretend we are in a sunny garden. We can feel the warm sun on our arms. We've collected some interesting maple leaves and a fluffy feather. We carefully arrange them on a special piece of paper that feels slightly damp. We watch as the paper's color changes in the bright light. The best part is yet to come: the big reveal when we wash it and see our creation appear!** The great thing about cyanotype is that it's easy and safe for people of all ages to try. You can buy kits online to make your own sun-prints at home. **(C) What objects from your own room or backyard would you choose to create your own sun-print masterpiece?**

(Upbeat music swells)

And that’s all the time we have for today's News Discovery Time! We've seen glowing forests, visited Mars with kid-designed robots, and learned how to paint with the sun. Keep asking questions, stay curious, and join me next week for more exciting stories from around our incredible world. This is Alex, signing off!

**主持人：** News Discovery Time! 今天我们要探索……Bang! Pop! Wow!……闪闪发光的森林、超级聪明的机器人，还有阳光的魔法艺术！大家好，欢迎收听我们的“青少年新闻速递”，我是你们的主持人小艾！今天我们准备了一些超级劲爆的故事，保证让你大开眼界。那我们这就开始吧！

我们的第一条新闻，要把我们带到地球上一些最古老的森林深处。科学家们最近观察到了一个非常奇特又美丽的现象。在南美洲的亚马逊雨林和澳大利亚的丹特里雨林里，一种特殊的蘑菇居然开始在黑夜里发光了！这种现象叫做生物发光，但这次的特别之处在于，这些相隔几千公里的神奇蘑菇，竟然以完全相同的节奏在闪烁！简直就像它们跨越了整个太平洋，在互相传递秘密信息一样。

研究**真菌学**（Mycology，就是专门研究蘑菇这些生物的科学）的专家们说，他们以前从没见过这样的事。他们记录下了这些闪光，发现里面有一种复杂的节奏，几乎就像一种秘密代码。这些被科学家们起了个外号叫“星星孢子”的蘑菇，覆盖了超大片的森林地面。**（A）要是你把两个大洲所有发光的地方都拼在一起，那面积相当于5000个标准游泳池那么大！** 这可真是一场盛大的自然灯光秀。

**（B）想象一下：晚上，你正走在又黑又潮湿的雨林里。你能听到奇怪的虫鸣，脚下踩着软软的落叶。突然，你周围的地面开始闪烁起柔和的、有节奏的蓝光。一个个光点完美地忽明忽暗，照亮了你前面的小路。你肯定会感觉自己闯进了一个魔法童话世界！** 科学家们现在正拼命研究，想搞明白这是不是一种新的远距离沟通方式。**（C）如果是你，能用这些发光的蘑菇来发送信息，你想对全世界说些什么呢？**

（短暂的音乐过渡）

接下来，我们要从森林地面一飞冲天，飞向外太空……或者说，为飞向太空做准备！我们的第二条新闻，是关于科技、创意和一群超级聪明的孩子。**美国国家航空航天局**（NASA，也就是美国的太空总署）最近公布了他们一年一度的“火星小帮手机器人”大赛的获胜者。这项比赛是专门为中学生举办的，挑战是设计并制造一个小型机器人，来帮助未来的宇航员完成火星任务。

今年的冠军团队来自日本东京的一所学校！一个由五名12岁学生组成的小组，创造了一个超级有创意的机器人，他们给它取名叫“Kuri-chan”，在日语里是“小栗子”的意思。“小栗子”的特殊任务是给火星上的石头分类。它用一个巧妙的爪子和智能摄像头来识别不同类型的土壤和石块，把有研究价值的挑出来，简直不要太厉害！为了这个项目，队员们花了六个多月的时间，努力学习编程和工程知识。

**（A）“小栗子”的个头很小——也就三个午餐盒叠起来那么高。但你可别小看它！它那只特别的手臂超级有力，能举起一块相当于20个大苹果重量的石头。** 这个团队在全球科学博览会上展示了他们的机器人，评委们都对它简单又高效的设计感到非常惊讶。**（B）你来构想一下这个画面：你是第一批登陆火星的宇航员之一，正走在红色、布满灰尘的火星表面。天空是粉红色的，你还能看到地球像一个遥远的蓝色小点。你的机器人朋友“小栗子”就在你旁边滚来滚去，小心翼翼地捡起有趣的石头放进一个特殊容器里。你感觉特别安心和自豪，因为一个由孩子们设计的机器人正在帮你进行伟大的探索。** 这支冠军队伍赢得了一次明年去参观NASA太空中心的机会。**（C）如果你能为自己的日常生活设计一个机器人帮手，你最希望它帮你完成什么特别的任务呢？**

（短暂的音乐过渡）

我们最后一条新闻，来聊聊艺术和阳光！一项来自19世纪的、古老又美丽的艺术**技法**，最近在社交媒体上又重新火了起来。它的学名叫**蓝晒印相法**（Cyanotype），但你可能听过它更酷的名字：太阳印画！一场超赞的展览刚刚在法国巴黎开幕，展示了现代艺术家们如何用这种老办法，创作出令人惊叹的蓝白色图画。

你猜怎么着？它的原理就像魔法一样。艺术家们使用涂有一种安全化学物质的特殊纸张。他们把东西——比如树叶、花朵、羽毛，甚至剪纸——放在纸上，然后把它放到太阳底下。阳光会和纸上没被盖住的地方发生化学反应。几分钟后，他们用水冲洗这张纸，一幅细节丰富、颜色是深蓝色的美丽图案就出现了！

**（A）这次巴黎的展览展出超过200件蓝晒作品。有些很小很精致，但其中一件由一个艺术家团队创作的巨幅作品，竟然和一辆学校巴士一样长！** 它展现的是一头和实物一样大小的蓝鲸，全都是用阳光画出来的。**（B）我们假装自己正在一个阳光明媚的花园里，能感觉到太阳暖暖地照在胳膊上。我们收集了一些有趣的枫叶和一根毛茸茸的羽毛，小心地把它们摆在一张感觉有点湿润的特殊纸上。我们看着纸的颜色在阳光下慢慢变化。最棒的部分就要来了：当我们用水冲洗它，看到自己的作品显现出来的那一刻，简直太神奇了！** 蓝晒印相法最棒的地方就是，它又简单又安全，所有年龄段的人都可以尝试。你可以在网上买到工具包，在家里制作属于你自己的太阳印画。**（C）你会从你的房间或者后院里挑选什么东西，来创作一幅属于你自己的太阳印画杰作呢？**

（欢快的音乐声增强）

好啦，今天的“青少年新闻速递”时间就到这里了！我们看到了发光的森林，和孩子们设计的机器人一起“去”了火星，还学会了怎么用太阳来画画。请大家一定要保持提问、保持好奇心，我们下周再见，一起探索我们这个奇妙世界里更多激动人心的故事。我是小艾，我们下期再会！
