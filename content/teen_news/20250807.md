### **Story 1: A World on Alert as Wildfires Rage**

Summer is a time for sun and fun, but it has also brought a serious challenge to our planet: wildfires. Recently, a massive fire in the Aude (奥德) region of southern France has shown us just how powerful nature can be.

This fire was enormous. It has burned over 15,000 hectares of land. It’s hard to picture how big that is, so let's try. An area larger than the entire city of Paris has been scorched by the flames! That is like watching more than 15,000 soccer fields turn from green to black. The fire was so huge that astronauts could even see the smoke from space. Firefighters described it as a *catastrophe* (灾难/disaster) on a scale they have not seen in many, many years. Strong winds, very dry plants, and hot weather created the perfect storm for the fire to spread incredibly fast.

Imagine you are standing in a peaceful French village. You can smell flowers and hear happy birds singing. Suddenly, you see a dark cloud on the horizon, much bigger than a rain cloud. The air starts to feel warm, and you can smell smoke. Soon, the sky turns orange, and you hear a distant roar. This is what thousands of people have experienced. They had to leave their homes for safety, and brave firefighters from all over the country have rushed to help.

This isn't just happening in France. Wildfires have become a major concern in many parts of the world, from North America to Australia. Scientists believe that changes in our planet's climate are making these events happen more often. They are working hard to understand how we can better predict and manage these fierce fires.

The brave firefighters are true heroes, battling the blaze day and night. But we can all be heroes for our forests, too. By being careful with fire and following safety rules when we are outdoors, we can help prevent these terrible events. What do you think is the most important rule to remember when you go camping or have a picnic in the woods?

### **Story 2: AI Helpers March into Classrooms**

Get ready for a school revolution! In the Guangxi (广西) region of China, a super exciting plan has just been launched. By 2027, schools from elementary to high school will have powerful AI helpers. AI means Artificial Intelligence (人工智能), which is about making computers think like humans.

So, what does this actually mean for students? Imagine walking into your classroom. Instead of just a regular teacher, you might have an AI teaching assistant! It could be a friendly robot that walks around or a fun cartoon character on a giant smart screen. This AI helper has learned all about your progress. It knows which subjects you love and which ones are a bit tricky for you. It can create special games and quizzes just for you, making learning feel like playing. If you are stuck on a tough math problem, the AI can show you a colorful animation to explain it step-by-step. This plan aims to *integrate* (整合/combine) AI into every part of learning. By the time a student who is in fourth grade today starts middle school, this amazing AI education system will be helping them every day.

This project isn't just about making classes more fun. It is also about preparing kids for the future. The world is changing fast, and technology like AI is becoming more important. By learning with AI now, students will be better prepared for future jobs that might not even exist yet! The plan also includes connecting students in primary schools with universities, so younger kids can get inspired by the cool projects older students are working on. There will even be special courses like "AI + Robotics" to spark everyone's curiosity.

The government is building a huge digital platform, like a giant brain for all the schools in Guangxi, to support these AI tools. It will be full of resources, lessons, and fun activities that teachers and students can use.

This sounds like a school from a science fiction movie, but it's becoming real. If you could design an AI helper for your school, what special powers would you give it? Would it be a homework helper, a language tutor, or maybe a creative partner for your art projects?

### **Story 3: Tianjin's Twinkling Transformation at Night**

When the sun goes down, most cities get quiet. But in the city of Tianjin (天津), the fun is just beginning! The city has transformed its nights into a magical experience with lights, music, and countless activities, creating an amazing "night economy."

Picture this: you are standing beside the famous Haihe River (海河). The sky is dark, but the city is glowing with a rainbow of colors. Lights from tall buildings dance on the water, making it look like a river of stars. You can hear soft music drifting from a pop-up coffee festival, where people are chatting and laughing. You feel a cool, gentle breeze as a tour boat, decorated with bright lights, sails by. These boats have become floating stages, with some offering comedy shows or even opera performances!

This incredible project shows real *vibrancy* (活力/liveliness). To make this happen, the city has upgraded its streets, organized surprise "flash mob" concerts, and invited artists to show their work. The result? The city feels alive and full of energy after dark. The night cruises on the Haihe River have become incredibly popular. There are 29 boats making over 70 trips every single night. That’s like having more than two whole classrooms full of boats, each one packed with happy tourists, exploring the river's beauty every evening.

This new focus on night tourism has created a wonderful atmosphere for both locals and visitors. It also gives young entrepreneurs a chance to shine, with many setting up small stalls to sell creative crafts or delicious snacks. It’s not just about sightseeing; it's about creating a community where people can relax, connect, and feel the joyful pulse of the city.

This idea is spreading across China. More and more cities are realizing that the night holds special magic. So, here's a fun challenge for you! Why not become a "nighttime explorer" in your own town? With your parents' permission, you could plan a safe walking tour to see how your neighborhood looks after sunset. You could even draw a map and mark the best spots for stargazing or seeing city lights. If you were in charge of planning a night festival, what would you include? A treasure hunt with flashlights? A storytelling corner under the stars?

**(Outro Music starts softly)**

**Host:** And that’s all the time we have for today's News Discovery Time! We have seen how people are bravely facing nature's power, how technology is changing our schools, and how creativity can make our cities sparkle. Keep asking questions, stay curious, and join us next time for more amazing stories!

### **第一条：全球警惕，野火肆虐**

夏天是阳光和欢乐的季节，但它也给我们的地球带来了严峻的挑战：森林野火。最近，在法国南部的奥德（Aude）地区，一场巨大的火灾向我们展示了大自然的力量有多么惊人。

这场火灾的规模太大了。它烧毁了超过15000公顷的土地。你可能很难想象这有多大，我们来试试看。这片被火焰吞噬的面积，比整个巴黎市还要大！这就好像看着超过15000个篮球场，从绿色一下子变成了焦黑色。这场火灾是如此巨大，宇航员甚至能从太空中看到它产生的烟雾。消防员们说，这是一场很多年都没有见过的巨大*灾难*（catastrophe/disaster）。强风、干燥的植物和炎热的天气，简直是给大火配齐了“风火轮”，让它蔓延得飞快。

想象一下，你正站在一个宁静的法国小村庄里。你能闻到花香，听到鸟儿快乐的歌唱。突然，你看到地平线上出现了一片乌云，比雨云大得多。空气开始变热，你闻到了烟味。很快，天空变成了橘红色，你还听到远处传来“轰隆隆”的声响。这就是成千上万人的亲身经历。他们不得不为了安全离开家园，而来自全国各地的勇敢消防员们则火速赶来支援。这火也太大了！

这种情况不仅仅发生在法国。从北美到澳大利亚，森林野火已经成为世界许多地方都非常关心的问题。科学家们认为，我们地球的气候变化，正在让这类事件发生得越来越频繁。他们正在努力研究，怎样才能更好地预测和控制这些凶猛的大火。

那些勇敢的消防员日夜奋战，是真正的英雄。但我们每个人也可以成为保护森林的小英雄。在户外活动时，小心用火，遵守安全规则，我们就能帮助避免这些可怕的事情发生。你觉得去野外露营或野餐时，最应该记住的一条安全规则是什么呢？

### **第二条：AI小助手，走进我们的教室**

准备好迎接一场校园大变革吧！在中国广西（Guangxi），一个超级激动人心的计划刚刚启动。到2027年，从小学到高中的学校，都将拥有强大的人工智能（AI / Artificial Intelligence）小助手。人工智能，就是让电脑像人一样思考的技术。

那么，这对同学们来说到底意味着什么呢？想象一下，你走进教室，迎接你的可能不止有老师，还有一个AI助教！它可能是一个会走路的友好机器人，也可能是一个巨大智能屏幕上的卡通人物。这个AI小助手已经了解了你的学习情况。它知道你喜欢哪些科目，也知道哪些知识点对你来说有点难。它可以专门为你设计特别的游戏和问答，让学习变得像玩一样有趣。这可真是帮大忙了！如果你被一道数学难题卡住了，AI可以播放一个五彩缤纷的动画，一步一步地为你讲解。这个计划的目标，就是把AI*整合*（integrate/combine）到学习的方方面面。等到今天上四年级的同学开始上初中的时候，这个神奇的AI教育系统就会每天陪伴他们学习了。

这个项目不仅仅是为了让课堂更有趣。它也是在为孩子们的未来做准备。世界变化得很快，像AI这样的技术正变得越来越重要。现在就开始和AI一起学习，同学们就能更好地为未来的工作做好准备，那些工作可能现在都还没有出现呢！这个计划还包括把小学生和大学联系起来，这样小朋友们就能从大哥哥大姐姐们的酷炫项目中获得灵感。学校还会开设像“AI+机器人”这样的特色课程，点燃每个人的好奇心。

为了支持这些AI工具，一个巨大的数字平台正在建设中，它就像是广西所有学校的“超级大脑”，里面装满了老师和同学们可以使用的各种资源、课程和好玩的活动。

这听起来就像科幻电影里的学校，但它正在变成现实。如果你可以为你的学校设计一个AI小助手，你会给它什么超能力呢？是帮你检查作业，还是教你说外语，或者成为你美术课上的创意好搭档？

### **第三条：天津的夜晚，被魔法点亮**

太阳下山后，大多数城市都安静了下来。但在天津（Tianjin）市，乐趣才刚刚开始！这座城市把它的夜晚变成了一个充满魔法的奇妙世界，到处都是灯光、音乐和数不清的活动，创造出了一个超棒的“夜间经济”。

想象一下这个画面：你正站在著名的海河（Haihe River）边。天已经黑了，但整个城市却像彩虹一样闪闪发光。高楼大厦的灯光在水面上跳舞，让河水看起来像一条流淌的星河。你能听到从旁边的咖啡节上传来轻柔的音乐，人们在开心地聊天欢笑。那气氛，绝了！当一艘装饰着明亮灯光的游船驶过时，你能感受到凉爽的微风。这些船已经变成了移动的舞台，有的船上还有喜剧表演，甚至还有歌剧表演呢！

这个不可思议的项目充满了*活力*（vibrancy/liveliness）。为了实现这一切，城市升级了街道，组织了惊喜的“快闪”音乐会，还邀请了艺术家来展示他们的作品。结果呢？天黑以后，整座城市都充满了生机和能量。海河上的夜间游船变得特别受欢迎。每天晚上有29艘船，要跑70多个来回。这就好像每天晚上，都有两个多班级的船，载满了开心的游客，在河上探索夜的美景。

这种对夜间旅游的新玩法，为本地人和游客都创造了美好的氛围。它也给了年轻的创业者一个展示自己的机会，很多人摆起了小摊，售卖有创意的手工艺品或者美味的小吃。这不仅仅是观光，更是创造了一个社区，让人们可以放松、交流，感受城市快乐的心跳。

这个点子正在全国流行开来。越来越多的城市意识到，夜晚藏着特殊的魔力。那么，给你一个有趣的挑战！为什么不在你自己的城市也当一个“夜间探险家”呢？在爸爸妈妈的同意下，你可以规划一条安全的步行路线，去看看你家附近天黑后是什么样子。你甚至可以画一张地图，标出最适合看星星或者看城市灯光的地方。如果你是夜间嘉年华的策划人，你会加入哪些活动呢？用手电筒玩的寻宝游戏？还是在星空下的故事会？
