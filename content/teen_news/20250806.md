News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore...
**(Sound effects: Bang! Pop! Wow!)**

Hello, amazing explorers, and welcome back to our weekly news adventure! I'm your host, bringing you the most fascinating stories from around our incredible world. Today, we have two fantastic reports. First, we will solve the great cicada mystery: why does one continent find a buzzing bug annoying, while another finds it absolutely delicious? Then, we will zoom into a high-tech farm where young scientists are using super-gadgets to grow the perfect tomato. So, buckle up!

Our first story takes us on a journey that connects different continents through a tiny, buzzing insect: the cicada. This summer, a strange thing has happened. In the city of Shanghai, China, many people have felt annoyed by cicadas. They buzz loudly all day, and sometimes they spray little drops of liquid, which is basically their waste after drinking tree sap. It feels like a surprise mini-rain shower when you walk under a tree! People in Shanghai have found this quite bothersome.

But now, let's travel to another part of China, the province of Shandong, and we will see a completely different picture. Here, people don't just tolerate cicadas; they celebrate them! They call the young cicadas, which have just crawled out of the ground, "知了猴 (zhī liǎo hóu)," which means "cicada monkeys." At night, families go out with flashlights on a mission. It's like a treasure hunt! They search on tree trunks and leaves for these little brown nymphs. Some people have even started using advanced tools like thermal imaging cameras to find them more easily.

Why the big hunt? Because in Shandong, cicada nymphs are a famous delicacy. They are cooked in many ways: deep-fried until they are golden and crispy, stir-fried with spicy peppers, or grilled on a barbecue stick. People say they are crunchy and packed with protein. One pound of these cicada nymphs can sell for over 100 yuan. That's a lot of money, almost like paying one dollar for a single crunchy cicada! For the price of a popular video game, you could buy a big bucket of them. Imagine you are sitting in a park in Shandong. You can hear the happy sounds of families searching for cicadas, their flashlights dancing in the dark. It’s a fun summer activity that brings everyone together.

This love for eating insects isn't unique to Shandong. All over the world, people have been eating insects for centuries. In Mexico, in North America, people enjoy crispy grasshoppers called chapulines. In Thailand, in Asia, you can find street vendors selling a variety of fried bugs, from crickets to bamboo worms. So, what one culture sees as a pest, another sees as a delicious protein-packed snack. It shows how diverse our world is. It makes you wonder, if your friend offered you a plate of crispy fried cicadas, would you be brave enough to try one? What do you think it would taste like?

Our second story is about science, technology, and some very special tomatoes. We are heading to a farm in Ningbo, a city in China, where a group of university students have become science heroes for a local farmer.

Farmer Chen has a very large farm, covering over 120 mu of land. That’s a huge area, almost the size of 190 basketball courts put together! He uses cool technology like smart systems to control the temperature in his greenhouses and automatic machines to water and fertilize his plants. He has become famous for his delicious cherry tomatoes and has even won awards for them. But Farmer Chen had a problem. He wanted to make his tomatoes even healthier and tastier, but he didn't know how. He needed some super-science help.

This is where our young heroes step in. A team of university students from Ningbo University heard about his problem and decided to help. They brought a very powerful and special tool from their lab to the farm: a mass spectrometer (质谱仪/zhì pǔ yí). A mass spectrometer is a scientific instrument that can analyze things at a molecular level, helping scientists see exactly what something is made of.

Imagine you are one of these young scientists. You feel the heat inside the greenhouse as you carefully collect samples. You take little bits of soil from different depths and pick tomatoes at different stages of ripeness – green ones, yellowish ones, and fully red ones. You have to label everything perfectly. Then, back in the bright, clean university lab, the real magic begins. The students have used the mass spectrometer to test these samples. The machine helps them understand if there are any harmful heavy metals in the soil and, more importantly, what kinds of good nutrients are in the tomatoes. This information is like a secret recipe for growing perfect plants. With this data, they can give the farmer scientific advice on how to improve the soil and *optimize* (to make something better/improve) the growing conditions.

The students have been working very hard, turning complex data into simple, easy-to-understand suggestions for Farmer Chen. This project has been a fantastic experience for them. It shows that science isn’t just about reading books or working in a lab. It’s about using knowledge to solve real-world problems and help people. These students have taken what they learned in the classroom and used it to make a real difference in their community. Their work will help the farm produce safer, more nutritious, and even more delicious tomatoes.

This story makes us feel so inspired! These students are proving that with science and a desire to help, young people can achieve amazing things. It makes you think, if you had a machine that could analyze anything, what would you want to test first? Your favorite snack, the water in a nearby river, or maybe even a rock from your backyard?

That's all the time we have for today's News Discovery Time. We have learned that a bug can be both a pest and a treasure, and we have seen how young people are using technology to change the world, one tomato at a time. Keep exploring, stay curious, and we'll see you next week for more amazing stories!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索...
**(音效：Bang! Pop! Wow!)**

嘿，各位了不起的探险家们，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻大冒险！我是你们的主持人，为你们带来我们这个奇妙世界上最引人入胜的故事。今天，我们有两条超棒的报道。首先，我们要解开一个关于蝉的大谜团：为什么在同一个大洲，有人觉得这种嗡嗡叫的虫子很烦，而另一些人却觉得它美味无比？接着，我们将飞速冲进一个高科技农场，看看那里的年轻科学家们是如何用超级设备种出完美番茄的。所以，坐稳啦！

我们的第一个故事，要通过一种嗡嗡叫的小昆虫——蝉，带我们进行一次连接不同大洲的旅行。今年夏天，发生了一件很奇特的事情。在中国的上海市，很多人被蝉的叫声搞得心烦意乱。它们整天大声鸣叫，有时候还会喷出小小的水滴，这其实是它们喝完树汁后的排泄物。当你走在树下时，感觉就像突然下了一场迷你阵雨！上海的居民们觉得这太讨厌了。

但是现在，让我们把目光投向中国的另一个地方——山东省，我们将会看到一幅完全不同的景象。在这里，人们不仅不讨厌蝉，反而还很欢迎它们！他们管刚刚从土里爬出来、还没长出翅膀的蝉的幼虫叫“知了猴 (zhī liǎo hóu)”。一到晚上，家家户户就会拿着手电筒出门执行任务。这简直就像一场寻宝游戏！他们在树干和树叶上寻找这些棕色的小若虫。有些人甚至开始用热成像仪这样的高科技工具，以便更容易地找到它们。

为什么要这么费劲地寻找呢？因为在山东，“知了猴”是一道有名的美食。它们的做法五花八门：可以油炸到金黄酥脆，可以和辣椒一起爆炒，还可以串在烧烤签上烤着吃。人们说它们吃起来嘎嘣脆，而且蛋白质含量很高。一斤“知了猴”能卖到一百多块钱呢。这可是一大笔钱，差不多相当于一个脆脆的蝉就要花掉一块美元！用一个热门游戏的价格，你就能买上一大桶了。想象一下，你正坐在山东的一个公园里。你能听到家人们寻找知了猴的欢声笑语，他们的手电筒光束在黑暗中跳舞。这是一项有趣的夏日活动，让每个人都聚在了一起。

这种喜爱吃昆虫的习惯并不只是山东才有。在世界各地，人们吃昆虫已经有好几百年的历史了。在北美洲的墨西哥，人们喜欢吃一种叫做“chapulines”的脆脆的蚱蜢。在亚洲的泰国，你可以在街边小摊上找到各种油炸虫子，从蟋蟀到竹虫，应有尽有。所以，一种文化里被看作是害虫的东西，在另一种文化里可能就是富含蛋白质的美味小吃。这充分说明了我们的世界是多么的多元化。这让你不禁思考，如果你的朋友递给你一盘香喷喷的炸知了猴，你敢不敢尝一个？你觉得它会是什么味道呢？

我们的第二个故事是关于科学、技术和一些非常特别的番茄。我们要去中国宁波市的一个农场，在那里，一群大学生为当地的一位农民伯伯当上了科学小英雄。

陈伯伯有一个非常大的农场，占地超过120亩。那可是个超大的地方，差不多相当于190个篮球场拼在一起那么大！他用了很多很酷的技术，比如用智能系统来控制温室里的温度，用自动化机器给植物浇水施肥。他种的小番茄特别好吃，已经很有名了，甚至还获过奖。但是陈伯伯遇到了一个难题。他想让他种的番茄更健康、更好吃，但他不知道该怎么做。他需要一些超级科学的帮助。

就在这时，我们的年轻英雄们登场了。一个来自宁波大学的学生团队听说了他的难题，决定来帮忙。他们从实验室里带来了一个非常强大又特别的工具：质谱仪 (zhì pǔ yí)。质谱仪是一种科学仪器，它可以在分子的层面上分析东西，帮助科学家看清楚一样东西到底是由什么构成的。

想象你就是这些年轻科学家中的一员。你感受着温室里的热气，小心翼翼地采集样本。你从不同深度的土壤里取一点土，再摘下不同成熟度的番茄——有绿色的、有半黄的，还有完全变红的。你必须把每一样东西都标记清楚。然后，回到明亮干净的大学实验室里，真正的魔法开始了。学生们用质谱仪来检测这些样本。这个机器能帮他们了解土壤里有没有有害的重金属，更重要的是，能知道番茄里有哪些有益的营养成分。这些信息就像是种出完美植物的秘密配方。有了这些数据，他们就能给农民伯伯提出科学的建议，告诉他如何改良土壤，以及如何*优化*（让某个东西变得更好/改善）生长环境。

这些学生们一直非常努力，他们把复杂的科学数据，变成了简单易懂的建议，交给了陈伯伯。这个项目对他们来说是一次超棒的经历。它说明了，科学不仅仅是读书或者在实验室里做实验。科学更是用知识去解决现实世界的问题，去帮助别人。这些学生们把课堂上学到的知识，用来为自己的社区做出了真正的贡献。他们的工作将会帮助这个农场生产出更安全、更有营养，也更美味的番茄。

这个故事真是太励志了！这些学生证明了，只要有科学知识和一颗乐于助人的心，年轻人就能做出不起的事情。这让你不禁想，如果你有一台可以分析任何东西的机器，你最想先测试什么呢？是你最爱吃的零食，是附近河里的水，还是你家后院的一块石头？

今天的新闻探索时间就到这里了。我们知道了，一种虫子既可以是害虫，也可以是宝贝；我们还看到了，年轻人正在用科技改变世界，一次一个番茄地去努力。请继续保持探索精神和好奇心，我们下周再见，收听更多精彩的故事！
