News Discovery Time! Today we will explore... Bang! Pop! Wow! ...glowing butterflies, helpful robots, and sound secrets from around the world!

**First up, a mystery that has lit up the night sky across two continents.**

Scientists have been amazed by a recent event involving the Starlight Monarch butterfly. We have all seen butterflies fluttering in the sunshine, but these beautiful blue butterflies are special. They have a natural glow! This phenomenon is called bioluminescence (by-o-loom-in-ES-sens), which means they can produce their own light, just like fireflies. For years, we have known that these butterflies travel thousands of miles from their homes in the mountains of Mexico. But recently, something incredible has happened. For the first time ever, huge swarms of these glowing butterflies have been seen in southern Spain, all the way across the Atlantic Ocean!

Entomologists (en-to-MO-lo-gists), who are scientists that study insects, are very excited. They have never seen a migration this large or this far. The group of butterflies seen in Spain was so big that it covered an area of sky equal to 20 basketball courts! That's a lot of butterflies! Imagine you are standing in a quiet field in Spain late at night. The air is cool and you can see the stars. Suddenly, you feel a gentle breeze and see thousands of tiny, pulsing blue lights floating all around you. You can hear the soft, silent flutter of their wings. It’s a magical, moving carpet of light. This is a truly *unique* (/one-of-a-kind/) discovery that shows us nature is still full of surprises. Scientists are now studying if changes in weather patterns have helped these tiny travelers on their fantastic flight. If you discovered a new glowing animal, what would you name it?

**Next, we have a story about how young inventors are using technology to clean our planet.**

Our beaches are beautiful, but they have a big problem: microplastics. These are tiny pieces of plastic, smaller than a grain of rice, that can harm sea animals. But now, there’s a new hero on the sand. Engineers have designed a small robot called "Pebble" to help solve this plastic pollution problem. Pebble is not very big; it’s about the size of your lunchbox. But it is very smart and *efficient* (/effective/). It uses a special camera to see microplastics and a small vacuum to suck them up without hurting the sand or any tiny creatures. One Pebble robot can clean an area the size of an entire school swimming pool in just one day!

But here is the best part: kids are helping to make Pebble even smarter! A global competition was held for students to design the best software to guide the robots. Teams from all over the world participated, and the winning team was from a primary school in Auckland, New Zealand. Their program helps Pebble learn the shape of a beach and plan the best path to clean it quickly. Picture yourself on a sunny beach. You hold a tablet and draw a zig-zag line on the screen. A little Pebble robot zips across the sand, perfectly following your command, and you can hear its quiet hum as it gobbles up harmful plastics. You are its commander, protecting the ocean! This project has shown everyone that you are never too young to make a big difference with your ideas. What other helpful job could a small robot like Pebble do for our planet?

**Finally, let's listen to a story about art, memory, and the sounds of our lives.**

What does your world sound like? Is it the busy bees buzzing in a garden, the cheerful bell of an ice cream truck, or the sound of rain tapping on your window? An international art project called "Sounds of Our Sphere" has been collecting sounds from children all over the world to create a special kind of time capsule. Instead of pictures or letters, these capsules *preserve* (/save/) moments in sound. Over the past year, children from more than 80 countries have used their phones or simple recorders to capture the sounds that are important to them. The collection now includes over 5,000 different sound clips! If you tried to listen to all of them back-to-back, it would take you three full days and nights!

The project was created by an artist who believes that sound tells a story that our eyes can't see. Close your eyes for a moment. Imagine you can hear the happy shouts from your favorite playground, the sound of your family laughing at dinner, or the quiet rustle of book pages turning. These sounds feel personal and can bring back strong memories. The collected sounds have been put together into a massive online sound-map where you can click on a country and hear its unique sounds.

And guess what? You can make your own sound capsule, too! It’s easy. First, think about three sounds that represent your day. Second, use a phone to record them. It could be your pet making a funny noise or the sound of your favorite video game. Third, save the files and write down why you chose them. You can share them with your family or keep them to listen to in the future. What three sounds would you put in your own sound time capsule to show someone in the future what your world is like?

That’s all for today’s News Discovery Time. Keep exploring, keep asking questions, and we’ll see you next time!

新闻探索时间！今天我们要飞速探索……Bang! Pop! Wow!……发光的蝴蝶、能干的机器人，还有来自世界各地的声音秘密！

**首先，一个点亮了两大洲夜空的神秘事件。**

最近，一种叫做“星光帝王蝶”的蝴蝶让科学家们大吃一惊。我们都见过蝴蝶在阳光下飞舞，但这些漂亮的蓝色蝴蝶可不一般。它们自己会发光！这种现象叫做生物发光，意思就是它们能像萤火虫一样自己制造光。很多年来，我们都知道这种蝴蝶会从它们在墨西哥山区的家乡出发，展开几千公里的旅行。但最近，一件前所未有的事情发生了。有史以来第一次，大群大群发光的蝴蝶出现在了西班牙南部，整整跨过了一个大西洋！简直不要太神奇了！

Entomologists（昆虫学家，就是专门研究昆虫的科学家）对此感到非常兴奋。他们从没见过规模这么大、距离这么远的迁徙。在西班牙看到的那群蝴蝶大到什么程度呢？它们覆盖的天空面积，相当于20个篮球场那么大！那得有多少蝴蝶啊！想象一下，深夜里你正站在西班牙一片安静的田野上。空气凉凉的，天上挂着星星。突然，你感到一阵温柔的微风，成千上万个蓝色的小光点在你身边漂浮、闪烁。你几乎能听到它们翅膀安静扇动的声音，就像一张会移动的魔法光毯。这真是一个独一无二的发现，告诉我们大自然里还藏着好多好多惊喜。科学家们现在正在研究，是不是天气变化帮助了这些小小的旅行家，完成了这次奇妙的飞行。如果是你发现了一种新的发光动物，你会给它取什么名字呢？

**接下来，我们来听一个关于小发明家们如何用科技清洁我们地球的故事。**

我们的海滩很美，但它们有一个大麻烦：微塑料。这些是比米粒还小的塑料碎片，会伤害海洋动物。不过现在，沙滩上有了一位新英雄。工程师们设计了一个名叫“卵石”的小机器人，来帮助解决这个塑料污染问题。“卵石”个头不大，差不多就你的午餐盒那么大。但它非常聪明，而且工作效率很高。它用一个特殊的摄像头来识别微塑料，再用一个小小的吸尘器把它们吸走，同时不会伤害沙子或者任何小生物。一台“卵石”机器人，一天就能清理完差不多一整个学校游泳池那么大的面积！

但最厉害的部分来了：我们的小朋友正在帮助“卵石”变得更聪明！一个全球性的比赛邀请全世界的学生来为这些机器人设计最好的导航软件。来自世界各地的队伍都参加了，最终获胜的是新西兰奥克兰一所小学的团队。他们编写的程序能帮助“卵石”学习海滩的形状，并规划出最快的清洁路线。想象一下，你正站在阳光明媚的沙滩上。你拿着一个平板电脑，在屏幕上画出一条“之”字形的路线。一个小小的“卵石”机器人就嗖地一下冲过沙滩，完美地执行你的命令，你还能听到它在吞食有害塑料时发出的嗡嗡声。你就成了它的指挥官，在保卫海洋呢！这个项目告诉大家，无论年龄多小，你的想法都能带来巨大的改变，这可不是开玩笑的。像“卵石”这样的小机器人，还能为我们的地球做些什么有用的工作呢？

**最后，让我们来聆听一个关于艺术、记忆和我们生活中的声音的故事。**

你的世界听起来是什么样的？是花园里蜜蜂嗡嗡的忙碌声，是冰淇淋车传来的叮当声，还是雨点敲打窗户的滴答声？一个叫做“我们的地球之声”的国际艺术项目，一直在收集来自全世界儿童的声音，用来制作一种特别的声音时间胶囊。这些胶囊里装的不是照片或信件，而是用声音“保鲜”的瞬间。在过去一年里，来自80多个国家的孩子们用手机或简单的录音设备，录下了对他们来说很重要的声音。现在，这个收藏已经包含了超过5000个不同的声音片段！如果你想把它们全部听一遍，需要花上整整三天三夜的时间！

这个项目是由一位艺术家发起的，他相信声音能讲述我们眼睛看不到的故事。大家闭上眼睛一会儿。想象一下，你能听到你最喜欢的操场上传来的欢笑声，家人在晚餐时开心的笑声，或者翻书时安静的沙沙声。这些声音是不是感觉很亲切？它们可以唤醒我们内心深处的记忆，简直太有感觉了。所有收集到的声音被制作成了一张巨大的在线声音地图，你只要点击一个国家，就能听到那里独特的声音。

你猜怎么着？你也可以制作自己的声音胶囊！方法很简单。第一步，想一想哪三种声音最能代表你的一天。第二步，用手机把它们录下来。它可以是你家宠物发出的搞笑声音，也可以是你最喜欢的游戏背景音乐。第三步，保存好文件，并写下你选择它们的原因。你可以把它们分享给家人，或者留着以后自己听。你会把哪三种声音放进你自己的声音时间胶囊，向未来的人展示你现在的世界是什么样的呢？

以上就是今天“新闻探索时间”的全部内容。继续探索，保持好奇，我们下次再见！
