## English Version

Hello everyone, and welcome back to the Teen News Express! Your weekly update on what's happening in the world, especially for you! Let's dive into some interesting stories from today, May 14th, 2025.

We have some amazing news from high up in Tibet, where a city called Nagqu, which is very, very high above sea level, has managed to grow lots of trees! This is super special because it used to be called the "city without trees". Imagine that! It shows how much people can do when they work together for a long time.

We also have important news about keeping safe online, some exciting new technology that sounds like science fiction, and even a look at some super cute, tiny animals!

Let's take a closer look at a few of these stories.

First up, great news for students in Beijing! The city has announced a **new plan** (that's like a set of ideas or rules) to help students like us be healthier and happier. This plan is not just about how strong your body is, but also about your **mental health**. Mental health means how you feel inside, like being happy, dealing with stress, and getting along with others.

The new plan says that schools should help us do things that are good for both our bodies and our minds. They want us to join clubs or groups with friends, have special days to talk with our teachers, and they are even encouraging parents to spend more time talking and doing fun things with their kids every day. Schools will also try to have more team sports like football and basketball because playing together helps us learn to be strong and never give up.

They are also thinking about our time online. They want to make sure we don't spend too much time looking at screens and that the things we see online are good for us. They are asking grown-ups and companies to work together to make the internet a safer place for young people. This plan is about making sure we grow up happy and healthy in every way! Isn't it great that they are thinking so much about us?

Next, let's talk about being online. We hear a lot about **'child stars'** on the internet, which means kids who become famous by making videos online. Sometimes these videos are very funny or show kids doing amazing things. But lately, people have been talking a lot about whether this is always good for the children.

There have been stories about some kids who might be asked to do things just to get more people to watch their videos, and sometimes it seems like their parents are earning a lot of money from it. This has made people worry if the kids are really happy and safe. Think about it, should a child have to work like that?

Because of these worries, China has been making new **regulations** (these are like official rules made by the government) to protect kids online. There's a law called the **Minor Protection Law** (Minor means someone under 18, like us!). This law has special parts about keeping us safe online. It says that websites and apps shouldn't try to make kids spend too much time on games or watching videos if it's not good for them. It also says that no one should be mean or nasty to kids online, which is called **cyberbullying**. Cyberbullying is using the internet to hurt someone's feelings or reputation (how people think about you).

The government and schools are working together to teach us how to be safe and smart when we are online. They want to make sure that what we see and do on the internet is helpful and not harmful. It's super important to know these rules so we can enjoy the internet safely and respectfully!

Now, get ready for some super cool technology! Imagine controlling your phone or computer just by thinking about it! Scientists are working on something called a **brain-computer interface** (that means a way for your brain and a computer to talk to each other).

Apple, the company that makes iPhones and iPads, is working with another company to develop this technology. It's being developed to help people who cannot move their bodies very well, maybe because they have a sickness or an injury. With this technology, they might be able to use their thoughts to move a mouse on a screen or even type words!

This is still quite new, but it's already helping some people. One person who can't move much used this technology to explore virtual reality (that's like stepping into a computer game world!). It might take a few more years before it's ready for everyone, but it shows how amazing technology can be, helping people connect with the world in new ways. It's like having your thoughts become the controls! Wow!

And finally, for a quick animal update! Have you ever heard of a **Pygmy Hippo**? These are like smaller, cuter versions of the big hippos you might see at the zoo. Pygmy means very small! They only live in certain forests and swamps in West Africa.

Unlike their big cousins who love being in large groups in the water, Pygmy Hippos are quite shy and prefer to be on their own or just with their mum. They are only about the size of a pony and weigh around 200 kilograms. That sounds heavy, but it's much lighter than a big hippo that can weigh over 1500 kilograms!

Their skin is dark and secretes (makes) a special red liquid that helps protect them from the sun and keeps away germs. They walk around the forest at night looking for leaves and fruit to eat. Sadly, there are not many Pygmy Hippos left in the wild, mostly because their homes are disappearing and sometimes people hunt them. They are very special animals, and hopefully, people can work together to protect them!

That's all for today's news express! Remember to stay curious, stay safe online, and keep exploring the world around you! See you next time!

各位同学大家好！欢迎回到青少年新闻速递！这里有每周为你准备的世界最新鲜资讯！今天，2025年5月14日，我们一起看看发生了哪些有趣的故事吧。

首先，来自西藏高海拔地区有个好消息！那曲，这座平均海拔超过4500米的城市，成功种活了很多树！这真是件超级特别的事情，因为过去这里被称为“没有树的城市”。你能想象吗？这告诉我们，只要人们长期一起努力，就能做成很多看起来不可能的事。

我们还有一些关于如何安全上网的重要新闻，一些听起来像科幻小说一样激动人心的新技术，甚至还有一些超级可爱的小动物！

接下来，让我们详细了解一下其中的几条新闻。

第一个，给北京的同学们带来一个好消息！北京发布了一项**新计划**（就像一套主意或规定），旨在帮助我们这样的学生变得更健康、更快乐。这项计划不仅关注你身体有多强壮，还关注你的**心理健康**。心理健康是指你内心的感受，比如是否快乐，如何应对压力，以及如何与他人相处。

新计划说，学校应该帮助我们做对身体和心灵都有益的事情。他们希望我们加入俱乐部或小组，和朋友们一起玩；设定专门的日子可以和老师聊天；甚至鼓励家长每天花更多时间和孩子们交流，一起做有趣的事情。学校还会 कोशिश增加团队运动，比如足球和篮球，因为一起运动可以帮助我们学习坚持不懈、永不放弃的精神。

他们还考虑到了我们在线的时间。他们希望确保我们不会花太多时间看屏幕，并且网上看到的内容对我们是有益的。他们呼吁成年人和公司一起努力，为青少年创造一个更安全的网络环境。这项计划是为了确保我们在各方面都健康快乐地成长！他们这么关心我们，是不是很棒呢？

接下来，我们聊聊上网安全。我们经常听到网络**“童星”**，意思是有些孩子通过在网上发布视频变得有名。有时候这些视频非常有趣，或者展示了孩子们做得很棒的事情。但最近，大家开始讨论这对孩子们来说是否总是好的。

有一些新闻报道说，为了让更多人看视频，有些孩子可能被要求做一些事情；而且看起来他们的父母通过这些视频赚了很多钱。这让人们开始担心孩子们是否真的开心和安全。想想看，一个孩子应该像那样工作吗？

因为这些担忧，中国正在制定新的**规定**（这些是政府制定的正式规则）来保护孩子们上网。有一部法律叫做**《未成年人保护法》**（未成年人就是指18岁以下的人，比如我们！）。这部法律中有一部分是专门讲如何保护我们上网安全的。它规定网站和应用程序不应该提供让未成年人沉迷的产品或服务，如果这对他们不好。它还规定任何人都不能在网上对孩子们进行恶意攻击或散布谣言，这叫做**网络欺凌**。网络欺凌就是利用互联网伤害别人的感情或名誉（大家对你的看法）。

政府和学校正在一起努力，教我们在网上如何保持安全和聪明。他们希望确保我们在网上看到和做的事情是有益的，而不是有害的。了解这些规定超级重要，这样我们才能安全、有礼貌地享受互联网！

现在，准备好迎接一些超级酷炫的技术吧！想象一下，只用你的想法就能控制手机或电脑！科学家们正在研究一种叫做**脑机接口**的技术（这意味着你的大脑和电脑之间可以互相交流）。

苹果公司，就是生产iPhone和iPad的公司，正在与另一家公司合作开发这项技术。这项技术是为了帮助那些身体行动不便的人，比如因为生病或受伤而不能很好地活动的人。有了这项技术，他们也许可以用自己的想法来移动屏幕上的鼠标，甚至输入文字！

这项技术还很新，但已经开始帮助一些人了。一位行动不便的人就用这项技术体验了虚拟现实（就像进入一个电脑游戏的世界一样！）。这项技术可能还需要几年才能普及到每个人，但这表明科技多么神奇，它可以帮助人们以新的方式与世界联系。这就像让你的想法变成遥控器！哇！

最后，来个小小的动物新闻吧！你听说过**倭河马**吗？它们就像你在动物园里可能看到的大河马的迷你可爱版。倭（wō）的意思就是很小！它们只生活在西非的某些森林和沼泽里。

和它们喜欢在大水域成群生活的大表兄不同，倭河马非常害羞，喜欢独来独往，或者只和妈妈在一起。它们体型只有小马驹那么大，体重“才”大约200公斤。听起来很重，但比能重达1500多公斤的大河马轻多了！

它们的皮肤是深色的，会分泌（产生）一种特殊的红色液体，可以帮助它们防晒和抵抗细菌。它们晚上会在森林里四处寻找树叶和水果吃。可惜的是，野外剩下的倭河马数量不多了，主要是因为它们的家园在消失，而且有时人们会猎杀它们。它们是非常特别的动物，希望大家能一起努力保护它们！

今天的新闻速递就到这里啦！记住保持好奇心，安全上网，继续探索你身边的世界吧！我们下次再见！
