## English Version
Hello everyone! Welcome to our Youth News Express for May 14th, 2025! We have some exciting and interesting news stories to share with you today.

First, we have wonderful news about people helping each other by donating special cells. Also, a city high up in the mountains is planting many trees where none could grow before! And listen to this, a duck in Switzerland was caught speeding by a traffic camera! Plus, Beijing has a new plan to help students stay healthy and happy.

Let's take a closer look at a few of these stories!

Our first detailed story is about helping others. The China Marrow Donor Program, a group that helps people give bone marrow and stem cells, has reached a big number! They have now helped with 20,000 donations. That's 20,000 times someone gave a special part of their body, called stem cells (these are special cells that can become different types of blood cells), to help someone who was very sick get better.

The 20,000th donor was a 22-year-old college student named Wang Juntao. He signed up to be a donor in 2021 and found out in February this year that he could help a patient. He said it was "totally worth it" to help save a life with just a few days of effort. This program is now the biggest in Asia and fourth biggest in the world, with over 3.6 million people ready to help!

Next, let's talk about a funny and unusual news story. In Switzerland, a traffic camera caught someone speeding, but it wasn't a car or a bike! It was a wild duck! The duck was flying at 52 kilometers per hour in an area where the speed limit (the fastest you are allowed to go) was only 30 kilometers per hour.

What's even funnier is that the police think this duck might be a "repeat offender" (someone who does the same thing wrong again and again)! They showed a picture from 2018 of a similar duck flying at the same speed in the same spot on the same day! Was it the same duck? Or just a funny coincidence? The police said the camera pictures are real and can't be changed. Maybe the duck was just in a hurry!

Finally, let's look at some news closer to home, about schools in Beijing. Beijing has started a new plan to help middle and elementary school students grow well in all ways. This plan says that keeping your body healthy and keeping your mind and feelings healthy are both very important, and they are connected.

The new plan has 20 ideas to help students. For example, it wants every student to join at least one school club or group they like. It also suggests having "Teacher-Student Talk Days" so students and teachers can talk more easily. For parents, the plan encourages them to talk with their children for 15 minutes and do activities together for one hour every day. Schools are also asked to have more team sports like soccer and basketball to help students become stronger inside (this is sometimes called psychological resilience). There will also be places in schools to help students with their feelings (like psychological support corners) and places to relax if they feel stressed (de-stress facilities). This plan shows that Beijing thinks it's very important for students to be healthy and happy!

That's all for today's news! Thanks for listening, and see you next time!

大家好！欢迎收听2025年5月14日的青少年新闻速递！今天我们要和大家分享一些令人兴奋和有趣的新闻故事。

首先，我们有一个关于人们通过捐献特殊细胞互相帮助的好消息。还有，一座在高山上的城市正在努力种树，那里以前连树都长不出来！听好了，在瑞士，一只鸭子因为飞得太快被交通摄像头拍到了！另外，北京有了一个新计划，要帮助学生们保持健康快乐。

让我们来仔细看看其中几个故事吧！

第一个详细故事是关于互相帮助。中国骨髓捐献计划，这是一个帮助人们捐献骨髓和干细胞的组织，已经完成了一个了不起的数字！他们现在已经帮助完成了20,000例捐献。这意味着有20,000次，有人献出了他们身体里一种特殊的细胞，叫做干细胞（这些是特殊的细胞，可以变成不同类型的血细胞），去帮助那些生了重病的人恢复健康。

第20,000名捐献者是一位名叫王俊涛的22岁大学生。他在2021年报名成为捐献者，并在今年2月得知他可以帮助一名病人。他说，只是花费几天的时间和精力就能挽救另一个人的生命，"完全值得"。这个项目现在是亚洲最大的，也是世界第四大的数据库，有超过360万人准备伸出援手！

接下来，我们来说一个有趣又不同寻常的新闻。在瑞士，一个交通摄像头拍到了超速的人，但不是汽车也不是自行车！而是一只野鸭！这只鸭子以每小时52公里的速度飞行，而在那个区域，限速（你被允许行驶的最快速度）只有每小时30公里。

更有趣的是，警察认为这只鸭子可能是一个"惯犯"（同一个错误一遍又一遍地犯的人）！他们展示了一张2018年的照片，照片里一只类似的鸭子在同一天、同一地点以相同的速度飞行！这是同一只鸭子吗？还是只是一个有趣的巧合？警察说摄像头拍到的照片是真的，不能更改。也许这只鸭子只是赶时间吧！

最后，我们来看一个离我们更近的新闻，是关于北京的学校。北京启动了一个新计划，帮助中小学生全面健康成长。这个计划说，保持身体健康和保持你的头脑和情绪健康都非常重要，而且它们是相互关联的。

这个新计划有20条措施来帮助学生。例如，它希望每个学生至少参加一个他们喜欢的学校社团或兴趣小组。它还建议设立"师生对话日"，让学生和老师更容易交流。对于家长，计划鼓励他们每天和孩子交流15分钟，一起活动一小时。学校也被要求组织更多像足球和篮球这样的团队运动，帮助学生增强内心力量（这有时叫做心理韧性）。学校里还会设立帮助学生情绪的角落（比如心理支持角）和感到压力时放松的地方（减压设施）。这个计划表明，北京认为学生健康快乐非常重要！

今天的青少年新闻速递就到这里了！感谢大家的收听，我们下次再见！
