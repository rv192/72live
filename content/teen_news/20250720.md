News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... **Bang! Pop! Wow!**

Hello, amazing explorers, and welcome back to our news roundup! I'm your host, ready to share the most exciting stories happening around our world. Today, we have seen some truly incredible things. We will journey from sparkling coastlines on opposite sides of the planet to a high-tech arena where kids are commanding robots. So, let’s get started!

### Story 1: Ocean's 'Blue Tears' Shine Bright on Two Continents

Our first story is a beautiful mystery from the deep blue sea. Recently, people on the beaches of California in North America and Tasmania in Australia have witnessed a stunning natural event. The ocean waves are glowing with a magical blue light at night! Scientists call this **bioluminescence** (bi-o-lu-mi-nes-cence, which means living things making their own light). The light is created by tiny ocean creatures called dinoflagellates. When the water is disturbed by waves or a hand splashing, they light up.

This amazing natural light show, sometimes called "Sea Sparkle" or "Blue Tears," has appeared more often this year. Why? Scientists think that warmer ocean water and specific nutrients have helped these tiny creatures grow in huge numbers. In just one liter of water, there can be up to 200,000 of them! That's like fitting the entire population of a small city into a single milk carton.

Imagine you are standing on a dark beach at night. You can hear the gentle waves washing ashore. Suddenly, as a wave crashes, it doesn't foam white, but glows with a brilliant blue light! You dip your hand in the water, and it sparkles as if you are holding a handful of stars. You can even see glowing footprints in the wet sand where you walk. This natural **phenomenon** (a special event / happening) reminds us how magical and surprising our planet can be. People have gathered on these brilliant blue beaches to see the amazing sight, taking pictures and enjoying the show nature has provided. It’s a perfect example of how living things, even tiny ones, can create something truly beautiful.

This has happened in different places around the world, connecting continents through a shared wonder. It shows that our planet’s oceans are full of secrets. What other amazing things are waiting to be discovered under the waves?

**Open-ended question:** If you could write a message in the glowing sand for everyone in the world to see, what would you write and why?

### Story 2: Young Geniuses Program Humanoid Robots

Now, let's blast off from the natural world into the world of technology! In a recent global competition, we have seen something straight out of a science-fiction movie. Children from all over the world have learned to code and control advanced **humanoid** (shaped like a human / man-like) robots!

The event featured robots from companies like **Unitree** (Yoo-ni-tree, a company that makes advanced robots). These aren't simple toys; they can walk on two legs, climb stairs, and carry objects. One of the most popular models can lift things up to 30 kilograms. To help you understand, that’s like a robot easily lifting a six-year-old child, or about 30 large watermelons! Kids as young as ten years old have been writing **code** (instructions for a computer / programming language) to make these robots perform specific tasks.

Picture this: you are in a huge, bright arena. You see a dozen humanoid robots walking, waving, and even dancing. But who is controlling them? It’s clever kids coding on their laptops, their faces full of concentration and excitement. They’ve written the instructions that bring these machines to life! They programmed the robots to complete an obstacle course, pick up a bottle of water, and even wave to the crowd. One team from Japan even programmed their robot to do a little dance after finishing its tasks, which made everyone cheer loudly.

This competition has shown that anyone can learn to be an innovator. These young participants have not only learned about programming and engineering, but also about teamwork and problem-solving. They had to fix bugs in their code and think creatively when their robot didn't do what they wanted. This event proves that the next generation of scientists and engineers is already here, ready to shape our future with technology.

**Open-ended question:** If you had a robot helper for one day, what three tasks would you ask it to do for you?

### Story 3: Flying High with Ultimate Frisbee

For our final piece of news, let's head to the park for a story about a fast, fun, frisbee sport that has become popular all over the globe. It's called **Ultimate Frisbee** (Uhl-ti-mit Friz-bee, a team sport played with a disc), and it’s a game that mixes speed, skill, and amazing sportsmanship.

Ultimate Frisbee is played on a field similar to a football field. Two teams try to score points by passing the frisbee to a teammate in the opponent's end zone. But here's the cool part: you can't run with the disc! Once you catch it, you have to stop and throw it to someone else. This makes for a game full of quick passes and exciting catches. A standard frisbee for this sport weighs 175 grams. It sounds light, but a great player can throw it over 100 meters! That's the entire length of a soccer field!

Let's go to the park! Feel the green grass under your feet and the sun on your face. Your friend is running far away. You spin the disc, snap your wrist, and watch it fly. It soars through the air, flat and steady, a perfect spinning circle heading right to your friend’s hands. You hear the *swish* of the air and the *smack* as they catch it! That’s the feeling of a perfect throw.

What makes this sport truly special is something called "Spirit of the Game." There are no referees! Players are responsible for following the rules and calling their own fouls. This requires a high level of respect and **integrity** (honesty / being fair) from everyone on the field. Because of this, the sport has created a friendly and positive community worldwide. Teams from the USA, Colombia, Japan, and many other countries now compete in world championships.

Want to try it? It's easy to start! All you need is a frisbee and a friend. Find an open space and practice a simple backhand throw: hold the disc with your thumb on top, curl your fingers underneath, stand sideways, and swing your arm across your body, snapping your wrist as you release. Go on, give it a fly!

**Open-ended question:** Ultimate Frisbee is known for its "Spirit of the Game," where players are their own referees. Do you think this could work in other sports? Why or why not?

新闻发现时间！今天我们要劲爆探索…… **砰！啪！哇！**

你好，各位了不起的探险家，欢迎回到我们的新闻快报！我是你们的主持人，已经准备好分享我们这个世界上最激动人心的故事啦。今天，我们见证了一些真正不可思议的事情。我们将从地球两端闪闪发光的海岸线，一路飞驰到一个高科技的舞台，那里的孩子们正在指挥机器人。那么，我们这就出发吧！

### 第一条：海洋“蓝眼泪”点亮两大洲

我们的第一个故事，是来自深蓝色大海的一个美丽谜团。最近，在北美洲的加利福尼亚和澳大利亚的塔斯马尼亚，海边的人们都亲眼看到了一个惊人的自然景象。夜晚的海浪，竟然闪耀着魔法般的蓝色光芒！科学家们称之为 **生物发光** (bioluminescence，意思就是生物自己制造光芒)。这种光是由一种叫做“甲藻”的微小海洋生物创造的。当海水被波浪或者划水的手搅动时，它们就会发光。

这个奇妙的自然灯光秀，有时候也被叫做“海洋闪光”或“蓝眼泪”，今年出现的次数特别多。这是为什么呢？科学家们认为，更温暖的海水和特定的营养物质，帮助了这些小生物大量繁殖。仅仅一升的海水里，就可能有多达20万个这种小家伙！这简直就像把一个小城市的所有人口，全都塞进一个牛奶盒里一样！

想象一下，你正站在一个漆黑的夜晚沙滩上。你能听到温柔的海浪拍打着海岸。突然，当一个浪花打过来时，它不是白色的泡沫，而是闪耀着灿烂的蓝光！你把手伸进水里，你的手也闪闪发光，就好像你正捧着一把星星。你甚至可以在湿润的沙滩上，看到自己走过时留下的发光脚印。这个自然的 **现象** (一种特殊的事件/发生的事情) 提醒着我们，我们的地球是多么神奇和充满惊喜。人们都聚集在这些亮晶晶的蓝色海滩上，欣赏大自然提供的这场表演，简直不要太厉害了！

这个景象在世界不同地方都出现了，通过一个共同的奇观连接了不同的大陆。它告诉我们，地球的海洋里充满了秘密。在海浪之下，还有多少奇妙的事情在等着我们去发现呢？

**开放式追问：** 如果你可以在发光的沙滩上写下一句话，让全世界的人都能看到，你会写什么呢？为什么？

### 第二条：小天才们编程操控人形机器人

现在，让我们从自然世界，一头扎进科技的世界！在最近的一场全球竞赛中，我们看到了一个像是科幻电影里才会出现的画面。来自世界各地的小朋友们，已经学会了编写程序，来控制先进的 **人形** (长得像人的/仿人的) 机器人！

这场活动展示了像 **Unitree** (宇树科技，一家制造高科技机器人的公司) 这类公司制造的机器人。它们可不是简单的玩具；它们能用两条腿走路、爬楼梯，还能搬运东西。其中一款最受欢迎的型号，可以举起重达30公斤的物体。为了让你更好地理解，这大概相当于一个机器人能轻松举起一个六岁的小朋友，或者说差不多30个大西瓜！年仅十岁的孩子们，就已经在编写 **代码** (给电脑的指令/编程语言)，让这些机器人去完成特定的任务了。

想象这个画面：你身处一个巨大又明亮的体育馆里。你看到十几台人形机器人正在走路、挥手，甚至跳舞。但谁在控制它们呢？正是那些聪明的小朋友们在笔记本电脑上敲着代码，他们的脸上写满了专注和兴奋。他们编写的指令，赋予了这些机器生命！他们给机器人编程，让它们完成一个障碍赛，捡起一瓶水，甚至还向观众挥手。有一个来自日本的团队，甚至还让他们的机器人在完成任务后跳了一小段舞，这让所有人都大声欢呼起来。

这场比赛已经表明，任何人都可以学会成为一个创新者。这些年轻的参与者不仅学到了编程和工程知识，还学到了团队合作和解决问题的能力。当机器人没有按照他们的想法行动时，他们必须修复代码里的错误，并创造性地思考。这件事证明了，我们的下一代科学家和工程师已经在这里了，准备好用科技塑造我们的未来，是不是很神气？

**开放式追问：** 如果你能拥有一个机器人助手一天，你会让它帮你做哪三件事情呢？

### 第三条：极限飞盘，飞得更高

我们最后一条新闻，让我们去公园里看看一个快速、有趣、用飞盘玩的运动，它已经在全球流行起来了。它叫做 **极限飞盘** (Ultimate Frisbee，一种用圆盘玩的团队运动)，这个游戏融合了速度、技巧和了不起的体育精神。

极限飞盘的场地和足球场差不多。两个队比赛，看谁能通过传递飞盘，让队友在对方的得分区里接住，从而得分。但最酷的地方是：你拿着飞盘的时候是不能跑的！一旦你接住了，就必须停下来，然后把它传给别人。这让整个游戏充满了快速的传接和激动人心的接盘动作。这项运动的标准飞盘重175克。听起来很轻，但是一个厉害的选手能把它扔出超过100米远！那可是一整个足球场的长度啊！

我们去公园吧！感受脚下绿色的草地和脸上温暖的阳光。你的朋友正向远处跑去。你转动飞盘，手腕用力一甩，看着它飞出去。它在空中平稳地翱翔，一个完美的旋转圆盘，正直直地飞向你朋友的手中。你能听到它划破空气的“嗖嗖”声和朋友接住它时清脆的“啪”的一声！这就是一个完美投掷的感觉。这可真有意思！

让这项运动真正特别的，是一种叫做“飞盘精神”的东西。比赛里没有裁判！球员们自己负责遵守规则，自己判罚犯规。这就要求场上的每一个人都有高度的尊重和 **诚信** (诚实/公平) 品质。正因为如此，这项运动在全球范围内建立了一个非常友好和积极的社区。来自美国、哥伦比亚、日本和许多其他国家的队伍，现在都会在世界锦标赛上同场竞技。

想不想试试？开始很简单！你只需要一个飞盘和一个朋友。找一个开阔的地方，练习一个简单的反手投掷：大拇指放在飞盘上面，其他手指蜷缩在下面，侧着身子，将手臂横过身体挥出，在松手的一瞬间手腕发力。去吧，让它飞起来！

**开放式追问：** 极限飞盘以它的“飞盘精神”而闻名，也就是球员自己当裁判。你认为这种方式可以在其他体育运动中也实行吗？为什么？
