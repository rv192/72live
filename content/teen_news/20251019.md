News Discovery Time! Today we are going to explore... Bang! Pop! Wow!

Hello, everyone, and welcome back to our weekly news update! I'm your host, ready to dive into some amazing stories. Today, we have a fascinating report about how technology is changing the way we grow our food. We have all felt the challenges of bad weather, like when heavy rain cancels our outdoor plans. But what happens when that rain threatens the food we eat? Let's find out how clever farmers are using super-smart technology to save the harvest and ensure we all have plenty to eat. This is a story of human ingenuity, giant machines, and tiny seeds that hold the key to our future. So, let’s get started on this exciting journey into the world of modern farming!

Our first stop is in Shandong province, East China. Farmers there have faced a big problem: persistent, or continuous, rainfall. Too much water can spoil crops, especially corn, making it moldy and unsafe to eat. But they have found a powerful solution!

Imagine this scene: You are standing near a huge building. You can hear a loud, steady humming sound, like a giant beehive. You feel a wave of warm air, and the air smells a bit like popcorn! This is a professional mechanical drying facility. In just one county called Wenshang, they have 65 of these amazing places working at full throttle. As of October, the county has set up 38 grain drying centers. Now, for the core data: together, these centers have a daily drying capacity of 9,500 tonnes!

To help you visualize that, an adult elephant weighs about 5 tonnes. So, drying 9,500 tonnes of corn is like drying the weight of 1,900 elephants every single day! This capacity has increased nearly five times compared to 2020. This incredible power helps farmers quickly dry their harvested corn, reducing losses from mold and making sure the autumn harvest is bountiful. We have seen how technology helps solve a very wet problem. If you had a machine that could dry things that fast, what would you use it for besides homework?

Now, let's travel to the northeast, to Heilongjiang province. Here, we can see another example of technology in action. On a massive cooperative farm, fields of plump soybean plants stretch as far as the eye can see. Suddenly, you see them: over 70 large harvesters moving back and forth in perfect lines. These machines are like giant, busy bees buzzing across the fields, gathering the soybeans with incredible speed. Shan Qingdong, the director of the cooperative, has said that their goal is to complete the entire harvest this week. This year, the cooperative planted more than 4,666.7 hectares of corn and soybeans. A standard international football pitch is about 0.7 hectares, so that's an area equal to nearly 6,700 football fields! It’s a huge job, but these machines make it possible.

But the technology doesn't stop with big harvesters. The cooperative has also introduced modern plant protection methods. Imagine you are looking up at the sky. You see a drone flying gracefully overhead. It's not taking pictures; it's performing aerial spraying. This method helps protect the plants from pests more efficiently. They have also used dense planting techniques, which are expected to *significantly/noticeably* boost soybean production. These scientific farming methods have been promoted by the local government and have already covered a vast area of grain fields in the province.

Finally, let's talk about the foundation of all farming: the soil and the seeds. Technology isn't just about big machines; it's also about making the land healthier and the seeds stronger. Across the nation, there are now more than 66.7 million hectares of high-standard farmland. How big is that? The entire country of Germany is about 35.7 million hectares. So this farmland is almost double the size of Germany! On this land, the fertility of the soil has been well preserved with technological advancement and scientific farm management.

In Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province, something very exciting happens during the harvest season: a "seed selection contest." Picture this: you are in a special experimental field. You see many different types of super rice varieties being cultivated. Farmers have come from all around to see them. They can compare the plants, check their quality, and even taste the cooked rice. It feels like a science fair for farmers! One veteran rice farmer, Zhu Shiyong, said he often visits to see which variety is best to choose. Last year, his farm achieved an amazing per-hectare rice yield of 11,250 kg!

This focus on science is making a huge difference. Agricultural technology now contributes more than 63 percent to China’s agricultural stability. While ensuring its own food security, China has also shared its experience with the world. For example, it has established 24 agricultural technology demonstration centers in Africa, helping to boost crop yields there by an average of 30 to 60 percent. It's wonderful to see how science is helping to *contribute/give* to a better future for everyone. If you could invent a new super seed, what special ability would it have?

That's all for today's News Discovery Time! We have seen how giant dryers, smart harvesters, flying drones, and super seeds are all part of a big story. It's a story about how humans are using their brains to work with nature and solve big challenges. Until next time, stay curious!

  新闻探索时间！今天我们要探索... Bang! Pop! Wow!

大家好，欢迎回到我们每周的新闻快报！我是你的主持人，准备好一头扎进今天奇妙的故事里啦。今天，我们有一则超级有趣的报道，是关于科技如何改变我们种植粮食的方式。我们都感受过坏天气带来的麻烦，比如一场大雨就让我们没法出去玩了。但如果这场雨威胁到我们吃的食物，那该怎么办呢？让我们一起来看看，聪明的农民伯伯们是怎么用超级智能的科技来拯救丰收，并确保我们大家都有充足的食物。这是一个关于人类智慧、巨型机器和决定着我们未来的微小种子的故事。那么，就让我们立刻出发，踏上这场激动人心的现代农业之旅吧！

我们的第一站，是中国东部的山东省。那里的农民遇到了一个大难题：持续不断的降雨。太多的水会让庄稼坏掉，特别是玉米，会让它发霉，吃了就不安全啦。不过，他们找到了一个超给力的解决方案！

想象一下这个场景：你正站在一座巨大的建筑物旁边。你能听到一阵响亮又平稳的嗡嗡声，就像一个巨大的蜂巢。你感觉到一股暖风吹来，空气里还有点像爆米花的香味！这就是一个专业的机械烘干中心。在一个叫汶（wèn）上县的地方，就有65个这样厉害的设施正在开足马力工作。截至10月份，这个县已经建成了38个粮食烘干中心。现在，核心数据来了：这些中心加在一起，每天能烘干9500吨粮食！

为了让你对这个数字有概念，一头成年大象大约重5吨。所以，每天烘干9500吨玉米，就好像把1900头大象那么重的玉米全都烘干一样！简直不要太厉害！这个处理能力和2020年相比，已经增长了将近五倍。这种惊人的力量帮助农民们快速烘干收获的玉米，减少了因为发霉造成的损失，确保了秋季的大丰收。我们看到了科技是如何解决一个“湿漉漉”的难题的。如果你有一台能这么快烘干东西的机器，除了烘干作业本，你还会用它来做什么呢？

现在，让我们把目光转向东北的黑龙江省。在这里，我们能看到另一个科技大显身手的例子。在一个巨大的合作社农场里，颗粒饱满的大豆田一望无际。突然，你看到它们了：超过70台大型收割机，正排着整齐的队伍来回穿梭。这些机器就像一只只巨大又忙碌的金属蜜蜂，在田野里嗡嗡作响，用惊人的速度收割着大豆。合作社的理事长单庆东说，他们的目标是在这个星期内完成全部的收割工作。今年，这家合作社种植了超过4666.7公顷的玉米和大豆。一个标准的国际足球场大约是0.7公顷，所以这片土地的面积相当于差不多6700个足球场那么大！这可是个大工程，但有了这些机器，一切都变得可能了。

不过，高科技可不只有大型收割机哦。这个合作社还引进了现代化的植保方法。想象一下，你抬头望向天空，看到一架无人机正在头顶优雅地飞行。它可不是在拍照，而是在进行空中喷洒作业。这种方法能更有效地保护庄稼，简直太酷了！他们还使用了密植技术，预计这将大大提高大豆的产量。这些科学的耕种方法由当地政府推广，并且已经在全省大面积的粮田里应用了。

最后，让我们来聊聊所有农业的根本：土壤和种子。科技不仅仅是关于大家伙，也关系到如何让土地更健康、种子更强大。在全国范围内，现在已经有超过6670万公顷的高标准农田。这有多大呢？整个英国的面积大约是2420万公顷。所以这些农田的面积差不多有三个英国那么大！在这些土地上，通过技术进步和科学的农场管理，土壤的肥力得到了很好的保护。

在辽宁省的省会沈阳，每到丰收季节都会发生一件特别好玩的事：“种子选拔大赛”。想象一下：你来到了一个特殊的试验田里，看到种植着许多不同品种的超级水稻。农民们从四面八方赶来参观。他们可以比较这些稻株，检查它们的品质，甚至还能品尝煮好的米饭。感觉就像是为农民举办的科学展览会！一位经验丰富的水稻种植户朱世勇说，他经常来这里看哪个品种最好。去年，他家的农场实现了每公顷11250公斤的惊人水稻产量！

这种对科学的重视正在产生巨大的影响。如今，农业科技对中国农业稳定性的贡献率超过了63%。在保障本国粮食安全的同时，中国也和全世界分享了自己的经验。例如，中国在非洲建立了24个农业技术示范中心，帮助那里的农作物产量平均提高了30%到60%。看到科学正在为全人类创造一个更美好的未来，这真是太棒了。如果你可以发明一种新的超级种子，你希望它有什么特殊能力呢？

以上就是今天“新闻探索时间”的全部内容啦！我们看到了巨大的烘干机、聪明的收割机、会飞的无人机和超级种子，它们都是一个宏大故事的一部分。这个故事告诉我们，人类正在如何运用智慧与自然合作，解决各种巨大的挑战。下次再见，请继续保持好奇心哦！
